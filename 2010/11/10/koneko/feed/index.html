		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.

I have this odd aversion to colons in fiction, they feel like things for lists of instructions.  I never consider using them for fun :)]]></description>

The bowler hat is a nice touch, especially for strolling in the forest with.

I have a couple of punctuation points.
&quot;Decision made, he moves on angling away from the more favoured path.  That is not where he needs to be, he has to take a different path.  Slowly he comes across a dense forest and slower still he makes his way through, it echoes his sorrow. &quot;
I would recast as

I&#039;m with AHS on the last paragraph.
I would&#039;ve liked a little more detail there, perhaps of the change.
It would have to be quite straightforward, not flowery, to match with the rest, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liked the imagery in this piece, although I did wonder why the witch was so willing to supply Our Hero with the fish, and what here jealousy was for. Like ElementalSystems, I assumed that this was because all of the characters knew more than we were being told (and when I reached the end I saw that it was).

&#062; His bowler hat is straight and his coat is clean.
I liked the bowler hat. Made me of Wimpy from Popeye (although I pictured the character looking more svelte and probably not as lazy).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this ambiguous legend - I loved the barely told affection between the man and cat/wife. Enjoyed the string sense of all the characters knowing much more than the reader about the situation. And I liked the very straight direct telling of the facts.

I found the last paragraph a bit hurried but don&#039;t really have a constructive suggestion regarding it - perhaps the work &#039;lovingly&#039; breaks the flow a little.]]></description>
