		<description><![CDATA[I loved this. You capture the cat very well in various bits - like the picking at food, slinking around, being jumpy at sounds. I particularly like the bits on the roof - the last two paragraphs and sentence. Unlike comovedy, I like the lightness that the last sentence and punctuation introduce. In a way this is fun for the cat - yes, he&#039;s challenging an interloper but he loves doing it :-)

I found it quite obvious that this was a cat - not sure how it would have been if the theme hadn&#039;t guided me, though. For me, the Mabel bit cemented it - something about the tone of her preparing the food felt more like for a pet than for a housemate or family member.

I think my favourite sentence is &quot;He found the acrid signs of a challenger on the wall near the top stair: inwardly he shuddered with excitement.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you liked it- thinking of making the catness less obvious in the rewrite; also perhaps changing the title to &#039;night walk&#039; or some such.

As for the detail I try to write what I know - teenager smoking in Hillbrow back alleys watching the cats on the fire escapes in the summer drizzle...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great capture of a cat: kinda mean, mostly disinterested in humans and their business.
Enjoyed the descriptive bits a lot: &quot;scatter of drizzle whipped between the dirty high rise blocks&quot; really jangled my wombats.

Not sure I like &quot;It was time to tussle!&quot; for the ending.
The sentence works for me, but the exclamation mark seems a little silly / frivolous compared to the fairly serious tone for the rest. Minor quibble, though.

Great stuff, man!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed how the cat was painted in almost a human light; no explicit mention of Our Hero being a cat is ever made. Personally, I would have liked the stretching in the first paragraph to not have been emphasised as much — given the theme and the title of the piece, I immediately pictured Our Hero as a cat, although Mable had me wondering if Our Hero was perhaps human.

I also enjoy the detail of the space, of the building that this cat inhabits and is wandering through: the stairs, the vents, and so on.]]></description>
