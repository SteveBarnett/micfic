		<description><![CDATA[This was great. You capture the first person spoken voice beautifully and it all rings true. Gives a lovely sense of local colour to the story. It&#039;s also a very neat description of a con. 

It is very skilfully put together: the way you provide all the information while keeping the narrator in the dark and maintaining the narrator&#039;s spoken voice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this a lot. Great idea and lovely voice. Enjoyed the way the mark almost seems to know that he&#039;s been taken and the reader perspective makes it clear.
Not sure I like the title- for those who knew the word it kills the fun in discovery - for the rest of us it&#039;s kinda pointless. Title suggestion: &#039;In the land of the blind...&#039;

Really enjoyed the local colour in the tone and language.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh! I&#039;ve been bitten by suite / suit so many times before, and I never learn. Bugger. It&#039;s one of those word-pairs I never notice when I&#039;m proof reading. Everything&#039;s just a suite to me. 

And I&#039;m really glad you liked the piece :) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Classic! Love the tone and language, very vivid, gives huge amounts of life to the familiar con scenario. You&#039;ve set it up very nicely to undercut the speaker&#039;s complacence with the reader&#039;s knowledge. I enjoyed this, thank you!

Minor nit-pick: gentlement wear a suit. Larney hotel rooms come in suites.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This made me laugh - what a great set up.  I can just see the scene in my head.  It reminded me of &#039;Hustle&#039;, which I enjoyed immensely. 

I like the way you wrote it how someone would actually say it, well, how someone like that would say it :P  Very cool.]]></description>
