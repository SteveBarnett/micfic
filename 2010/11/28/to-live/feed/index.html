		<description><![CDATA[This was great. Like Rudy, I realised it was some sort of contest or game, but did not think of Go. I really like the way you lead the reader into thinking this is a more serious (life-threatening) combat without making it seem odd for something that is just a board game, when this information comes out. I guess it helps that the game means so much to the player :-)

Lovely description of psychological play by both players. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice! I thought something odd was up when Our Hero was attacking his partner, but I did not expect Go :P Really great interpretation of &quot;eye&quot;.

The piece left me wondering if she&#039;d been playing him, trying to make him overreact (like with the condescending smile). I like to think that she was, since as the piece says, rash and angered playing doesn&#039;t win the game. 

Some nits:

&#062; lead to death for sure.
I thought that &quot;for sure&quot; sounded a bit informal compared to the rest of the piece.

Typo:
&#062; He bowed his head and [thought],]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely story. I love the way it seems so important to him from the inside (as games do when one is competing)  - love the vocabulary cross over with live and win; it worked well.

I also like how he loses; unusual ending for a piece like this but it works for me. For me his reaction to losing (realising his mistakes, determined to do better, admitting her superiority) balances his aggression while playing (humiliate her etc) in a cool way.]]></description>
