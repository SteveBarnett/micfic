		<description><![CDATA[Ah! Another &quot;each to his own&quot; issue, adverbs. I will moderate my crit to say while there is nothing technically wrong with adverbs, leaving them out usually results in more interesting ways of saying things - a challenge for the writer. But you&#039;re right, I do over-harp on them...! They don&#039;t particularly jar in this piece, so point taken.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments :-) It is a very silly piece, but I couldn&#039;t get the Eye of the Tiger (and associated tune) out of my head, so decided just to go with it...

Glad the characterisation worked for you. I&#039;m not sure about &quot;the man&quot; either. I&#039;m not completely unhappy with it, but I wanted to come up with an epic name - just found inspiration lacking and didn&#039;t want to use Indy (even though he was mostly who I was thinking of).

I don&#039;t really agree with you about adverbs. I think that, while one should be careful not to use them stupidly or overuse them (and certainly a lot can be gained from reading over something one has written and removing unnecessary text, or rephrasing overused terms), they can add a lot of descriptive power to a piece. I often find that they help me to visualise the nuances of a scene as the writer wants it, and don&#039;t feel distanced from the plot unless they have been crudely done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fun read! Liked the way you packed a whole tomb-raider into micfic length. The &#039;desert sands crossed so arduously; the barbarous blades and arrows evaded; the ancient traps disarmed.&#039; worked brilliantly in my mind&#039;s eye. Similarly the last sentence tells you all the rest of the story.

Loved how true to the genre you kept it - no matter how careful you are is never enough and the otherwise useful guide HAS to be too stupid and greedy in the end. And the lasso.

It wasn&#039;t especially Indiana for me;  reminded me more of the classic literature (Rider Haggard; Arthur Conan Doyle; Edgar Rice Burroughs) in this genre. 

Good light fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, this is very fun, and verges on the silly - I don&#039;t think I can read about &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; with a straight face. But given the Indiana Jones theme, the name of the stone is perfect and lends the right level of silliness.

I liked the characterisation of &quot;the man&quot;, pushing his hat back, not even blinking at the death of his guide, very Indy.

I&#039;m not sure about calling him &quot;the man&quot; throughout - I wasn&#039;t sure if he was Indy but you didn&#039;t want to say it, but I thought it jarred a bit. Especially since his guide has a name!

I also appear to be on adverb watch, and there are a lot of adverbs this time - this tends to distance the reader from the plot (telling not showing.

A fun story. Love the last line - disaster still pending.]]></description>
