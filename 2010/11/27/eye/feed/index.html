		<description><![CDATA[I think I must agree with the guys on this one.  I think it was a bit stressed.  To me, the sentence &#039;I can’t shake the feeling that it’s watching me, leering&#039; in the beginning is enough to set the threat in mind.  And as you read, the threat will grow along with the girl&#039;s fear.  

It could be that because I am a girl living in a city, the threat is already in my mind and so was an automatic assumption when I started reading.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As always, fascinated by the different responses in the comments. It&#039;s clearly more difficult to read this as a male reader than as a female, at least in the current tiny sample. This story is a fantasised embodiment of the fear of rape, basically - the gender issues are integral. I find it difficult to see how you can separate the character&#039;s fears from the male/female threat/victim associations, which I think is a failure on my part to take into account the different way a male or female reader is situated. The reality is that female fears in a threatening urban environment have an integral component of fearing sexual violence.

I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the detail and atmosphere; I can&#039;t work out if the fact of your being unsettled by the gender implications means the story isn&#039;t working, or if it means it&#039;s working really well. Darned political content.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought this was fantastic. It is gritty and creepy, and conveys a strong sense of hopelessness and hunted paranoia. The detailed graffiti descriptions are strong, clear and detailed, which adds a lot of power to the narrative. I really enjoyed the city descriptions and the casual notes on what the narrator was doing (on the bus, walking past a school in high heels, etc). These add a gritty realism which makes the fantastic elements more effective.

Unlike the others, I like the emphasis on the femininity of the narrator. It adds an additional dimension to the threat provided by the encroaching terror.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero travels around her city, discovering various bits of graffiti depicting bits and pieces of a man. These bits seem to be following Our Hero around town on her travels. Ultimately, this graffiti person comes closer and closer to her home, and the piece ends with a graffiti hand reaching in through her window. Our Hero is essentially being stalked by a gangster graffiti drawing; she seems scared of what it might do to her, although she seems to be waiting for it as it creeps into her home.

I liked this piece quite a bit. The writing style with the short phrases and list like descriptions is quite well done. I also thought that the description of her growing fear was controlled and well measured out (like via &quot;I walk faster, wish I wasn’t wearing heels.&quot;). The urban creepiness comes across well — reminds me of movies where people are trapped in inner city slums and are being hunted by gangs. Only nowhere near as OTT!

Like ElementalSystems, I also thought that threatening maleness of the graffiti and scared femaleness of Our Hero was stressed. I was unsure whether this was to make a statement about gender (was my first thought — but I couldn&#039;t come up with a satisfactory statement), or to bring out the stalker vibes. At the moment I&#039;m leaning towards the latter, especially when I reread the fourth paragraph where it&#039;s described in gangster-like, and its enormous &quot;endowment&quot; is pointed out. 

A little typo with either a full-stop or capitalisation:
&#062; yellow-brown. the eyelashes exaggerated]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this is lovely and deeply creepy in an appropriately urban way. I love the way it reinforces the loneliness and aloneness of urban settings - the way she can become paranoid over time with no one to tell about it.

Enjoyed the descriptions of the graffiti a lot: slowly becoming more threatening and more important to the narrator as the story goes on. &#039; The scale is identical&#039; really works for me - something creepy and intentional just there.

I was uncomfortable with the constant repetition of gender - it seems to be an important part of what  you are communicating but for me the association of female and vulnerable vs male and threatening is distracting from your character&#039;s growing fears. 

I liked &#039;Distributed graffiti. Odd, amusing, rather strange&#039; as a window on the narrators attitude. And found the last paragraph a excellent creeping climax.]]></description>
