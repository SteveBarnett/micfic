		<description><![CDATA[This was a very smooth and visually accomplished piece (iyswim), but it didn&#039;t really grab me, I&#039;m afraid. Sorry! :(

The writing is excellent, but I found it the story a little uneventful, even with the splatterhouse ending (which I did like). Perhaps, like Mr N above, I want more of the blood and guts?

I can&#039;t really offer some decent con crit to balance my whinging because the writing is good! Top bit for me was &quot;revealing rows of tiny, sharp, white teeth set prettily against the pink of her tongue.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice description of (I presume) you and Minx. This imagery was the best for me: &quot;she takes my nose into her mouth and holds it and my heart&quot;.

I also like the contrasting of the Minx&#039;s viciousness with her elegance in the last paragraph, although I thought that the last sentence rushed into it too quickly: I would prefer it to be a bit less abrupt (maybe longer? Maybe merely rewritten slightly?).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this - really liked how you got the individual brilliance of a specific cat not just the coolness of cats in general. 

Also liked the way the Cat/Human relationship is portrayed as intimate but not the cat is not personified much.

The last paragraph is cute,amusing and takes any sentimental edge offit very effectively - also ties back into the not humanising the cat vibe.]]></description>
