		<description><![CDATA[Good fun creepiness and a lovely perspective.

I liked the creeping dread fantasy set within the very everyday world. I like the way your respect for the evil cat within is clearly displayed. 

Fav Sentence: &#039;When Mr Muggles plays it’s always with living things: &#039;

I didn&#039;t think the technical medical words really worked this time round - the piece is too intimate - Like someone telling you a warning story and not really cold and clinical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this piece a lot. Mr Muggles is beautifully described, and I love how the piece flows smoothly from fairly normal cat description to macabre and creepy fantasy. I particularly liked &quot;When Mr Muggles plays it’s always with living things&quot; and &quot;But consider this:&quot; (an excellent intro to the creepy bit and nicely detached)

I agree about the x-ray bit, and also found the double &quot;his&quot; referring to different beings in &quot;rub his black coat against his leg&quot; a bit awkward.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Doc. The nit-pick is a good one: I personally think I was being overly pedantic with that x-ray description (not a good thing), and I cringe slightly when I reread it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is, as usual, beautifully paced and observed: the slightly detached tone works very well to convey the tension between the cute and the sinister. I really enjoyed the construction of the story through small details which build up into a horribly compelling picture. Bonus points for &quot;sashay&quot; and &quot;Examine, ye, my untouchable beauty&quot;, which are wonderfully atmospheric.

If I have to nit-pick, which really the piece doesn&#039;t merit, for me the sentence &quot;the glowing mass where Jack’s upper intestinal tract would have been if one could see soft tissue on an x-ray&quot; doesn&#039;t quite work, it feels a bit clumsy and not entirely meaningful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool, man.
Fun and cute but also sinister.
Must be the &quot;You might think that you’re safe&quot; ... eek!

You&#039;ve cracked out some great creepy &#039;This could happen to you..&#039; vibes with the hospitalisation and cutting and x-rays, and portrayed Mr Muggles as Predator really well.
I would not like to meet him in a dark alley.]]></description>
