		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this story as it stands and will avoid the temptation to compare to it&#039;s predecessor. I really got the sense of whimsy and strange feyness. Love the flow and density of the first two paragraphs a lot.

Best bits for me include  &#039;weaving its blades together in defiance&#039;, &#039;a myrtle leaf, to keep my own secret: in my dreams&#039;. Great writing - I love all the new ideas and surreal elements.

Minor nitpicks:
&#039;You dreamt of us, you say: in your dream, we were famous lovers, the masters of an old tower&#039; - seems to have too many commas to make sense after the colon I would have preferred &#039;say: in your dream we were famous lovers, the masters of an old tower&#039;. Also might have been tempted to remove the repetition of dream.
Also:
&#039;I would have given it its full attention&#039; - needs to be &#039;given it my full attention&#039; or &#039;given it the attention it deserved&#039; to make sense to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting - I completely agree that the protagonist comes across as shallow, basically callous, and that came out quite naturally that way. I was also saddened when I realised that the romance was just discarded like that (after a dream that spanned decades in dream time, but still, just discarded). But then I realised this is necessary - in the larger story, it turns out, these creatures are floating, and shallow, and change like the summer breeze - they love and forget, agonise and move on, within days if not hours. I decided that the sweetness of the first needed to be tempered with this realisation if the stories were to continue...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought this was lovely and magical like the first. I also see no problem with you dipping into this world again (in fact, its such a lovely world that I&#039;m glad you have).It has similar magical touches - the burning of the note and adding a leaf to keep things secret, and I love the sentence with the cat council. 

I do find this piece less magical than the first, partly because of comparison with the other. I don&#039;t like that the protagonist seems to regret the courtship which I found so beautiful in the first tale - it makes it seem more like necessary mating than a magical dance to be embraced.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awwww... sweet.
For me the world hasn&#039;t lost any of its charm (for its sequelity) and you&#039;ve plucked another beautiful, fanciful, vignette from it.

The rituals and the magicalness, especially of Our Hero&#039;s connection to the various animals, is lovely. There&#039;s a real feeling of a whole world on top of / under ours, with the cat councillors and all.

I did, in fact, L out L at &quot;but that old affair with the flute is not yet forgotten.&quot; Ha! Great stuff.]]></description>
