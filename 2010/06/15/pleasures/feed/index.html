		<description><![CDATA[The first two-three sentences are brilliant and a very accomplished beginning. That is not to say I don&#039;t like the way the story continues :) but those first couple of sentences really had me spellbound.

I enjoyed the coldness of Edward&#039;s mind and the creepy serial killer vibe, and the tiny, unexplained (did not need to be explained) story about power, loss of power and return to strength, and how his convictions rise and fall with that. Good insight.

I am easily distracted by word repetitions, and therefore felt the repeat of pleasure in particular was noticable. 

Thank you for an excellent story! Sorry it took me so know to find the time to comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the point of view from within Edward&#039;s mind. It means that what he is slowly dawns on one as the first paragraph is read, in an almost gentle and musing way. The juxtaposition with his own immediately dangerous situation, and how this becomes clear over the second paragraph works very well. In general, I enjoyed the way that the facts were unveiled.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoy Edward&#039;s lack of repentance: how, when he&#039;s under pressure, he&#039;s willing to reconsider his ways. But as soon as he&#039;s free, he&#039;s thinking of his next fix.

I&#039;m embarrassed to say that the first sentence had me thinking this was a play on Twilight! :P It had me confused for a bit. I think it happened because the character is called Edward, which got me thinking about vampires, and so the rest of the sentence made me think that Edward doesn&#039;t breath and hence was actually a vampire, and thus from Twilight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very groovy! I feel like there&#039;s definitely in improvement in style compared to the first one.
I&#039;m with Neil on the great &quot;voice.&quot;

The only bit that didn&#039;t quite work for me was &quot;And a bit frightening.&quot;
It didn&#039;t seem in character with the detached, controlled, personality that the rest of it gave off.
And maybe a little too much repetition of the word pleasure?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s great. Like the repetition of the word &#039;breath(ing)&#039; all through; it gives it a flow as the various surprising aspects of the story are revealed. 
I like the focus on knowing things others don&#039;t - secret power - everyone can identify with this (as opposed to inflicting torture which is less easy to identify with) and it makes you like Edward.

I wish Edward + death didn&#039;t have such strong awful pop-culture connections at the moment and wish you had chosen another name. The last paragraph feels a little hurried to me but this is an amazing amount to pack into the 250 words so I wouldn&#039;t know what to take out.]]></description>
