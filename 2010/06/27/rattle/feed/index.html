		<description><![CDATA[Great feel - I love the science-y detachment - forces all the emotive stuff to go in the readers head without any of your help. I like the introduction of the technical words (although personally I too vote against the italics) as a way to make the voice more removed and rational; and this intellectual rational coolness is often how one personally observes traumatic events (or at least I respond to trauma this way at first). 

The ending bit where you don&#039;t describe all the really nasty stuff (thrashing, gasping etc) really works for me; you couldn&#039;t have done it better than my brain. And &#039;even if you weren&#039;t watching carefully&#039; a beautifully placed cynicism.

Wish I could as write as deliberately and with such clear technical intent.
Not sure if the repetition of what one does or doesn&#039;t easily notice was deliberate but the similarity in form distracted me some small amount in a bad way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is ace! Cold, clinical, medical, detached and very creepy. Great writing.
I felt close to the action. Reading it induced a mild claustrophobic kind of feeling.
Despite that I really enjoyed the story :D.

+1 for consistency on the italics - the way they come out, &lt;em&gt;hyper&lt;/em&gt; feels like a tall, skinny, pale reaper pointing at a dictionary definition, whereas &lt;em&gt;exsang&lt;/em&gt; feels more like the cheery morgue attendant munching on his burger while showing you the body. Iyswim... (-_-)

Yay!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Akichan.  I thought the clinical feeling of the piece added to the detached way in which Troy viewed his life.  Life appeared to be a process for him and so his dying was a process as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This story made me cold just reading it. I agree with the general consensus within the comments that the story sustains a wonderful feel of detachment which, I imagine, mirrors Troy&#039;s feelings (or lack there of) throughout the story.

For this reason it reminded me of the Dexter books. Which, I hasten to add, is a good thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Docinatrix! I had a lot of fun writing this one. As to the end bit, I think that part of what could be making it feel a bit clichéd is that the last sentence is slightly on the melodramatic side. ]]></description>
