		<description><![CDATA[Heh heh...
I&#039;m not entirely sure if the captors are aliens or humans, but I was definitely going for the alien abduction vibes.

Thanks for the comment! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...and then, the anal probing!&quot;
At least, that&#039;s the picture in my head now.
Count me as another fan of &quot;Quasimodoing&quot;, BTW. Succinct word-pictures and all that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
I enjoy verbifying things.

Re lights: well, I have my own idea of what they are, but the story doesn&#039;t say.
It&#039;s left as an exercise for the reader ;-).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The micfic is about someone waking up in complete darkness, apparently in a blank room. As he attempts to find out where he is, strips of light appear in front of him. He then hears voices suggesting that he is a test subject.

I enjoyed the humorous tone, especially the verbification of &quot;Quasimodo&quot;. Very descriptive.

I didn&#039;t understand the ending, though :( What were the lights? Was it something I should have understood?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
I don&#039;t mind resonating in this, ahem, context. :)

I&#039;m quite happy with the finished product.
It sounds like I wanted it to sound.
I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You have a very nice line in catchy phrases. I&#039;d say &quot;catchy, resonant phrases&quot;, but you&#039;d laugh at me. Nose vices, and Quasimodoing. Quirky, but convey a huge amount. You set up voice very succinctly in such a short piece.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, man!
This was definitely influenced by Portal. It made a big impression on me.

I like the nose vice too :).
I was half-heartedly trying to make it sound not too much like me. I sort of like what I sound like, and sort of don&#039;t.

Re Starbucks: yep. I wanted that high street coffee chain too-hot-ness. Like they have a Large Hardon Microwave in the back just for making the coffee too hot to actually drink.]]></description>
