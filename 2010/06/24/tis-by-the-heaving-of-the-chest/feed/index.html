		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, glad you liked the story. I was pleased with getting a whole little myth into 250 words - but would have liked more...

Capitalisation: i saw all the capitalised nouns as place names. They are an isolated little tribe, and the Giant&#039;s body parts are obviously how they refer to places in their landscape. The Village, Tower, etc is pushing it more, but I still think of them as place names - when you have only one of everything, it can be the One, if you see what I mean.

I am happy with your intial confusion about the breath - I did want to add something about it happens every decade but had no room, but the alternative of thinking of it as an event of legend and then realising it is more frequent, but still very rare (every 10 - 20 years makes it very special) works for me and I have no problem with slightly confused readers... 

Thanks for the comments!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I&#039;ve been waiting for your comment partly because I really wanted the Rudy Summary (TM) :)

Interestingly, your reading of the story does not entirely reconcile with my intentions. I don&#039;t necessarily see this as a bad thing - in 250 words, all I can do is sketch a very fragile framework and it is interesting how people fill in the gaps. I think your interpretation is valid and the essence of the story is very similar. 

For info, my intentions for this story differ from your interpretation as follows:
- the people are not winged - they build flying machines
- the Giant sleeps, but every decade or so (not clarified in the story) he lets out a breath. The breath is the cue for all the youngsters to get on their flying machines and leave. It&#039;s a rite of passage and a quest, and my personal feel is that they come back many years later, having had their adventures and ready to settle down. But again, that is outside of the scope of the story.
- so the old guys stay behind. There is always a lot of cleanup after the breath, but it is not too dramatic.

Thanks for your comment and glad you enjoyed it. As I said, I am happy with alternative interpretations as long as I get the vibe across!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is about a group of winged creatures who are living on a sleeping giant on which they&#039;ve built up a whole village. The population waits for the giant to &quot;get fidgety&quot; in its sleep, at which point the village is either badly damaged or destroyed, and everyone flies away on the giant&#039;s increased breath. These migrations do seem like a regular enough occurrence for there to be a rhyme about it, and irregular enough for there to be enough time to settle down as a village.

I enjoyed this! The piece has a very strong viewpoint (first person plural as well; nice) where which the narrator doesn&#039;t attempt to have, &quot;Well, as you know, Bob, we live on the chest of a sleeping giant,&quot; style monologues with us.

I also enjoyed the language. Things like:
&#062; but it’s none that simple

and
&#062; know how to read them right.

The only real question / confusion this left me with (and it&#039;s a minor one), was what the giant was doing to cause the appropriate upheaval. I assumed it was waking up, but the last sentence seems to imply otherwise (the giant is still called a &quot;sleeping&quot; giant).

Have you read much by Gene Wolfe? This kind of strong viewpoint, with its constrained release of information to the reader — even the active hiding of information — is something he does very well; so if you enjoyed writing this, you might enjoy reading his work.

Thanks for sharing. I enjoyed reading this a lot!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like this one a lot, the general mysticism and romance of it is lovely - reminds me strongly of Clive Barker&#039;s Arabat (in a very good way). And I feel this is a very difficult style to get right (or to write). I understood the basic ideas clearly on first reading.

It is amazing how much content you got into the 250 words. Young vs Old ; climate change, interpret the evidence, birds and wildlife and finally the climax.That said I think it is too much and you need more words or less content.

I love the rhyme and think it adds a nice sense of realness - connect with our (very different) lives.

Some specific criticism: 
Capitalisation: For me if you are going to bend grammar with Stenum, Chest and Lip then it gets nasty when you also capitalise Tower, Village and Wind.

Story: For me there was a lot of confusion about how often this breathing thing happens - at the beginning I took it to be a legendary event, and even whether it will happen again seems questionable (something like an earthquake). Towards the end it is portrayed as a regular part of these peoples lives that they have seen before as children, and the old folk must have witnessed several times (like winter). This jarred me some and therefore me the (interesting and sweet) bit about mother&#039;s knowing their offspring will leave the nest and fly off was a bit breaking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! It is meant to leave you with question but the vibe you are describing is exactly what I wanted.

Your questions:

- Village and village - yes, the same, I did not notice I only capitalised one. On balance, I think I should capitalise both. Yes.

- Reading the village - basically, yes. In a more obvious context, reading who is coming to the meetings and who is already convinced enough to start building their flying machine. :)

- Noted about the sea - it also made me notice I used &quot;beneath&quot; twice in short order. Bad writer! No biscuit!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also loved the way this was written. It felt very steam-punky and dreamy, possible slightly post-apocalypty - when the event happened eons previously and no-one remembers how or what or why but there are hints as to what happened or happens and how to deal with it. I had a similar experience to docinatrix, but rather enjoyed it. It reminded me of work by John Crowley, which is incredibly beautiful to read but often doesn&#039;t make full sense to me during and sometimes after reading. I also liked the reimagining of objects which are very familiar - like China Mieville does. My visualisation was very similar to a Machinarium-style world. Yours did make more and more sense each time I re-read it, although, like comovedy, I have lots of questions :-)

It is difficult to criticise because of the dreaminess and strangeness of the piece. I was confused by the village and Village references - are they the same thing? Is reading the village, reading the people in it and their tension as the time grows close? Also, the reference to sea in the second last line, feels a bit out of genre. It broke my lovely dreamy story daze slightly. I would have preferred no reference to what is outside the Giant, so would probably leave out &#039;the sea beneath us&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, yes, the intention is absolutely to have the story only fully revealed at the end. Sorry if this is annoying - I really like that in a story, slowly grasping what the author intended as you try and make sense of the story, and in the end have enough to maybe piece it all together. 

Is it this approach that doesn&#039;t work for you or the execution?]]></description>
