		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for the very delayed crit. Am finally getting around to it!

It&#039;s an interesting autobiographical piece, letting people know what it&#039;s like to hand in that thesis! For me, the best part of it is the imagery in the last paragraph, especially the last sentence. I enjoy the tone as well: reaching towards something but not having gained it yet.

I also like the mixing of dialogue into bits of summary: &quot;Now, there is freedom. You must be so happy, people say.&quot; Nice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did someone just finish a thesis? That&#039;s what I got from it, and it felt so very real. Personal is good. &quot;Write what you know&quot;, they say, and this is a nice example of that. That and, is that a childbirth metaphor I&#039;m seeing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love the raw bio-idea. I really like the first paragraph - the change in sentence and phrase length and the sudden last sentence to jar really works for me.

I like the repetition &#039;First, there was..&#039; and &#039;Now, there is..&#039; - the structural repetition is interesting between these paragraphs, perhaps it could have been taken further?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the best part about this piece is how a person can relate to it - it&#039;s like finally finding the words to describe the situation you find yourself in.  And knowing how to describe it makes it easier to deal with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments. I was fascinated by how many different, and often conflicting, ways light could be interpreted/connotated ;-)

One of my favourite books is The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera, and I have always loved the way he explores the concepts of heaviness and lightness, and plays with their positive and negative associations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments. I am happy that you appreciated it and it is autobiographical. I wanted to start what is a slightly daunting exercise with a familiar style of writing, so you were either going to get academic discussion or diary-style musings :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely! I dig it.
Lots of nice imagery, and I like the two-way heavy / dark and light / light opposites.

I&#039;m also reading it as autobiographical, and it feels much more emotional for it, and raises / prods interesting introvert / extrovert questions / thoughts.

[Sorry about the slash overdose.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really appreciate this - I take it as very autobiographical, but as such it is a beautiful reflection of your state of mind. I feel I understand what you are going through so much better, and all these things I had never considered fit right in.

It&#039;s interesting that there is no real room in the world to express feelings in this heightened, lyrical way - but when it is done, so  much is communicated that would otherwise be missed. Thank you for sharing. :)]]></description>
