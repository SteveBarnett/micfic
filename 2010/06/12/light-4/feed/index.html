		<description><![CDATA[I like that you&#039;re never sure if the cheating was all in his head or not, I mean, I could see a roomful of friends ready to yell &quot;surprise&quot; or something, in one of those hilarious sitcom moments. At least, I want to, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case. Which saddens me. Good job!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely writing. I like the changes in tense and general structure of the piece. I like the foreshadowing of the first sentence but agree with those who have suggested it lacked in rhythm.

I like the internal states and emotional states expressed; they feel honest and raw - brilliant. &#039;She would smile I would smile &#039; - my fav bit, the elegance of plans in one&#039;s head.

The physical world is more of a problem for me, sometimes breaking the flow. The enter/look in fridge/leave come back etc. seems unlikely without: making a noise,changing clothes, turning on lights in the house, disturbing the sleepers or otherwise breaking the plot. That said you only have 250 words and I&#039;m not sure it can be fixed.

To nit pick: The sentence: &#039;Only the fridge had nothing but milk and mouldy cheese, the cupboards nothing but a box of oats&#039;. Really doesn&#039;t work for me - the fridge is the only appliance without food? Only == But? No verb in the second phrase?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely disagree :&#062; - I like the opening sentence, and I think the repetition works. It has the effect of a slightly stunned, shocked, disbelieving fixation on the basic elements of the situation. 

I overall like this a lot, it rings very true emotionally, and it&#039;s nicely restrained and understated in the depiction of the central infidelity. (Which I completely got first go, but now you point it out, there is ambiguity there and it works. Microfic as Rorschach test. Jo clearly has gremlins :&#062;.)

Where this didn&#039;t quite work for me was in the basic plot details, oddly enough. It was a bit distracting from the very real construction of emotions: I found myself wondering why the people upstairs didn&#039;t hear the speaker come in downstairs - not once, but twice. If they&#039;re being that quiet, it&#039;s not as if they&#039;re drowning him out? I also think stv&#039;s comments on the lack of food in the kitchen are valid - it&#039;s a good image in terms of foreshadowing the emptiness of their lives/relationship, but the need to go out and get food feels a bit contrived. 

And it&#039;s a damned good thing some of us are into realism rather than fantastic writing. Cross-pollination is good, and fantasy buffs possibly need grounding.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Maximo! That opening sentence seems to be a bit of problem. Oh well. 

I&#039;m looking forward to the next one. Will try to add additional smut for you ;)]]></description>
