		<description><![CDATA[This seems to me to be a piece about living with grief after losing a loved one. It offers hope that at some point the grief will pass.

I think this is a beautiful piece of writing. What works the most for me is the great sense of timing and rhythm in each sentence. For instance, &quot;Your feet move slowly, leaden; the world has a weight it didn&#039;t have before, it presses in on you.&quot; Lovely.

I wanted to offer something more constructively helpful; my apologies, but I can&#039;t offer much. AHS said that &quot;as light as nothing&quot; distracted him; it didn&#039;t distract me, but it does stand out slightly. Perhaps its the tense change, but I&#039;m undecided.

Thanks for sharing your work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This has a great vibe, beautiful density. I love the transition from present to future to present tense as a way of making time move - it works great and gives the story momentum. Particularly liked the firefly sentence - evocative and the reference to light really works.

The first section has a few awkward lines: the stones line; the repetition of &quot;feet&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; in a piece this short; the &quot;dark, alone at night&quot; that does not quite gel. &quot;Tentatively&quot; can go, and so can &quot;through the house&quot; in my view, but this is nitpicking. 
 
The main thing to watch out for when describing grief is that it&#039;s possible to sound like the main character is feeling sorry for themselves. This may well be the case and the intention, but I thought it was genuine, pure grief, and in that case the reader&#039;s sympathy should never waiver. Some of the first section does sound a little too elaborately described to maintain that sympathy. I am not sure if anything can be done about that, and it is not a major issue.

Thank you for writing a story, nice lady :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought this was a beautiful and emotional piece of writing. The imagery is powerful. I particularly love &quot;you stand shadowed and cumbersome while the chatter of others lifts and darts, like fireflies&quot;. That imagery is fantastic and the feeling recognisable, and I love the use of cumbersome.

It is difficult to criticise this piece, as it is so beautifully and carefully crafted, but I have two comments. The addition of &quot;heavy feet&quot; to the description of grief evokes large hobbit-feet for me, which interferes with the mood a little. I agree with docinatrix about the &quot;dark, alone at night, &quot; sentence - the beginning is a bit clumsy, but I love the comparison of darkness memes at the end.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fantastic writing. Love the complex mix of despair and hope. Came across to me as honest and beautiful.

Your writing is crafted and careful and I feel unqualified to critique at all but that is the point.
Love the change in tense from the dark present to imagined bright future.
Love almost all your metaphor like: &#039;tangible creature with the heavy feet&#039; and &#039;chatter of others lifts and darts, like fireflies&#039;. - fantastic, visual and thoughtful
But &#039;food sits in your stomach like stones&#039; jarred by comparison; also &#039;as light as nothing&#039; left my brain reeling in a distracting way for such a gentle piece.

The last paragraph must have been the most difficult; so few words left to get the uplifting-ness rocking. It all worked very well for me but I felt the very last sentence was slightly too &#039;much&#039; for my taste.

Wish I could have written this...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The tweaks were worth it. :)

No reshaping! Fire and forget only!
Ahem. There was almost an eyebrow there...

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you - I&#039;m glad it worked for you. It is indeed extremely crafted, I spent two days tweaking it - one of the reason a lot of my writing never sees the light of day is because I craft it &lt;i&gt;obsessively&lt;/i&gt; and never feel it&#039;s right. This is almost right, but looking back at it now I can see things that need more tweaking. For example, that sentence &quot;The dark, alone at night, will gradually cease to press&quot; is awkward and needs reshaping. But at this stage I feel that would be cheating :&#062;.]]></description>
