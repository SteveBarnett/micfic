		<description><![CDATA[Ah, but that&#039;s the trick! You want to go somewhere else, but you are compelled to follow... 

That and the circularity make it this neat little forever trap. Om nom nom. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brilliant idea. Very nostalgic for Choose Your Own Adventure readers. It&#039;s like the adult version there of. I enjoyed the dream like quality to it as well, inspires lovely dark imagery in my head :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mmmm, railroading. I wanted to go to the inn! Actually, I think the win, here, is that some of the side roads are as enticing as the ones we&#039;re already following, like the old geezer with his twitching package. Errm, you know what I mean.

Also liked the circularity of it. A little Zen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Basically, with the dreams sentence, it is a happier story: there is a good reason to keep chasing after the light. 

You take it out, and it becomes a much darker thing: a constant chase without reward, constant promise, no payoff...

It does occur to me that you and elementalsystems would prefer the different versions, in fact it&#039;s really telling :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved Choose Your Own Adventure books when I was a kid. Was great
seeing you play with the style. I also enjoy the circularity of it
(have you ever read Gödel, Escher, Bach?). I thought the writing style
was simple and evocative. I like it a lot.

Best image for me: &quot;Your dreams light up with alien beauty you will
never describe.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was very clever, funny and creepy. I disagree with elementalsystems. I really liked the sentence that he leaves out: your dreams light up with alien beauty...
To me it adds an otherness that enhances the mood of the piece, and then to have the loop is a wonderful thing to experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[oooh, cute. Spot-on piece of writing - the Choose Your Own adventure thing could be gimmicky, but the circularity and the restraint of the writing rise it right above that. I really liked this. Witty, punchy.

And, sorry, didn&#039;t mean to rip off the second person bit in mine, it&#039;s how I started it a week ago :&#062;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
You are right about the end - shorter works better. I felt there had to be a whole world in there for the endless chase to be worth it, but just chasing after that one touch - that&#039;s perfect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed it. Fun and clever. What a great romance, an only-dreamt of glow always just of of reach.

Best Bits:
Whole idea and the frustrated meme that the reader has control of the plot
Second person present tense - brave and brilliant and works here for me.
Like the use of the game-book style in the first paragraph (directions, lists and short declarative sentences)
Like the ending paragraph the most but...

Possible improvements: 
imho the last paragraph is slightly over-played, the best of it is brilliant on it&#039;s own:
Suddenly, there is warmth. You do not open your eyes. A small, hot hand rests on your cheek for a moment. 
You wake up.]]></description>
