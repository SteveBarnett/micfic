		<description><![CDATA[The rewrites really seem to work - it&#039;s become more restrained and tighter, somehow, by being less specific. It also makes you work a little harder to read it, in a good way - it&#039;s less on the surface of the narrative. 

Minor comment: I&#039;m now seeing a slight disconnect between the last three paragraphs, so that the man&#039;s anger at all he&#039;s suffered for this isn&#039;t quite connected to his disillusionment about the red carpet or the Master writing him off. If that makes any sense. It&#039;s Friday. I think I may need more tea.]]></description>
