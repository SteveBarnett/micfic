		<description><![CDATA[Hairy questions and hairy hecklers, I&#039;d say. (0_0)

Thanks for the comments, dude! :)
Stage presentation style-ee was definitely what I was going for.
Slick, but only until you look a bit closer. And realise how orange their skin is and how scary white their teeth are.

Re OTTness: yeah. Damn you, short form, and your low word count!
I think it&#039;s also tricksy to get the balance right between conversational I&#039;m-your-buddy-help-me-out-here and evangelical you-need-this-buy-this-now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! :)
I&#039;m glad the indirection worked.
My next one won&#039;t be fluffy - it will be SERIOUS.
Possibly.
Possibly not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yay! Thank you, Doc.

Re flow: I think it&#039;s a lot like how I speak. Note to self: develop Voice!
Yeah, I think about more monkeyspeak, especially more character work on the salesperson, but it came off too thick. And too long - 250 words!

I&#039;m quite happy with the off-camera action. I didn&#039;t want it to be cudgel-y, a la &quot;Please put down that chainsaw. That you are waving around. At me.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a product sales pitch attempting to sell a product for air purification. Everything goes slightly pear-shaped at the end, when the presenter faces some hairy questions. 

The opening sentence reminds me of the Sunscreen Song! :P

&#062; You will call it amazing.
Great line! The opening paragraph definitely reminds me of those American style, over the top, stage presentations that corporate people love giving.

I enjoyed the sales-pitchyness of the piece! I would have pushed the over-the-topness of the speaker&#039;s mannerism and style, and that of the pitch itself, but this was fun.

Also, last paragraph: my kind of humour :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right, I have serious work to avoid, so time for detailed comments. Loved, again, the little touches in the language: repetition of &quot;walk in the park&quot;, &quot;these little guys&quot; - you have an easy, colloquial flow going, and it really works. I might have been tempted to ramp up the marketing monkeyspeak a little, but it would possibly be too much. This is basically a classic dramatic monologue, and the assumed responses in the last few lines are extremely telling. Browning also ran.

I also really like the fact that this is deceptively light: it&#039;s actually black humour, there&#039;s serious commentary here on environment and on corporate irresponsibility, but it&#039;s beautifully inherent in the detail. 

Loved this. Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! :-D

The ® wouldn&#039;t really have come across in the speech, I think.
An under the breath quick mumble might have, though: 
&quot;We call it Breath allrightsreserved-registeredtrademark.&quot;

I am pleased with the egg bit :).]]></description>

I noticed the egg&#039;s &quot;pale blue sheen&quot; bit, BTW, well done. I especially liked the outro, from the comedy angle...]]></description>
