		<description><![CDATA[This made me laugh! Great punchline. I enjoyed it, and think that it was set up quite well. 

The characters&#039; voices worked for me: Chaturvedi sounded Indian, while if Andrew didn&#039;t sound in my head like you, he did sound South African. Also, I enjoyed your use of the Salamander imagery.

The very last line worked slightly less well for me (others have commented on it, but I feel less strongly about it). I do think it brings across the shock and surprise that we, the reader, should be feeling at what this &quot;conservative matriarch&quot; has just said. It heightens the humour for me.

I wondered what &quot;the old country&quot; was in terms of a South Africa tale. I assumed in this case it meant India. It doesn&#039;t sound like a very South African English term to me.

&#062; Lassi
Should this perhaps be lower-case?

&#062; quiet precise English
Wondering if you meant &quot;quiet&quot; or &quot;quite&quot;? If &quot;quiet&quot;, I would have liked it followed by a comma: &quot;her quiet, precise English&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was a great vignette from life. It seems that the curry description paragraph is generally favoured and I feel the same. It is the best part of the piece and beautifully descriptive. The metaphor at times is a little over the top - &quot;tsunami of tears&quot; and &quot;tubular inferno&quot; but this highlights how intense the heat is and really works in the context. I particularly liked the salamander bits.

I thought the introductory bits were good, but was a little confused by the race reference - it didn&#039;t seem to connect anywhere else and left me wondering how the grandma interacted with her grandson&#039;s non-white friends.

I also really enjoyed the two paragraphs following the curry description - they complete the vignette very well. &quot;Incoherent with laughter&quot; felt natural and really worked for me. And the grandmother&#039;s earthy humour also worked well. But, like parfles, I would prefer that the last sentence was left out because it ends the warm and amusing vignette with a slightly negative edge.

Lovely amusing piece, thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great description of death by heat - in some ways even more torturous than comovedy&#039;s hellfire story :) I loved the paragraph describing the heat, the one with the hot tar, infernos, tsunamis and salamanders. Excellent writing!

I would have liked the story to have a little more to say - some sort of, um, character growth (I know, 250 words, I know) but something that frames the account - why is this story being told? 

I would have inserted a comma in the first sentence:
&quot;It is already so late, Andrew, will you not stay for dinner with us?‚Äù

The last sentence is a bit of a let-down - after being able to laugh at himself earlier, the main character leaves on a forced, nervous smile, turning the experience into a bad one rather than one of some sort of personal progression. I would suggest leaving it off altogether - Grandma&#039;s warning is a great ending in itself!

Thanks, really enjoyed this one.]]></description>
