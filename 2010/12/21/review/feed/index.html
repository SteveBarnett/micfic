		<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting (and hence fun) piece of descriptive writing: how would someone experience being tortured in hell.

I enjoy the description: the detachment works well, and supporting Our Hero over a pit is great. 

One thing that at first didn&#039;t and then did work for me was the point of view. Our Hero wakes up in a very odd place indeed, but somehow recognises their situation with little effort. They also realise the state of their body (all their hurts and cuts and wounds) in quite trying circumstances with relative ease. It did make me wonder what was up (this is the not working bit), but then made complete sense when it was shown that the POV /wasn&#039;t/ the victim&#039;s. I&#039;ve put a âœ“ next to it working, but thought I&#039;d let you know what I was thinking nonetheless. 

Oh no! You&#039;ve used the verb GETâ„¢. I have a huge, untainted, feral hatred of the verb GETâ„¢, as in:
&#062; start to GETâ„¢ light-headed.

I recommend using almost anything else as an immediate drop-in replacement:
* start to grow light-headed
* start to become light-headed
* start to feel light-headed
* start to [anything but GETâ„¢] light-headed

Anyway, rant aside, I did enjoy this, and approve of your grittier side!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is wonderful, fun and clever, with great literary connections - Dante&#039;s Inferno, Iain Banks&#039; latest Surface Matter, and Rowan Atkinson stand up. I really enjoyed it. I didn&#039;t see the twist coming, but love the way it was foreshadowed in a way by the character&#039;s detachment from his torture (apart from the &quot;desperate scream&quot;, but I like that - it is appropriate that the devil feels some of the desperation of the body he briefly inhabits). 

The descriptions are beautifully crafted and I think you manage the segue from tortured soul to demon beautifully. &quot;Enough&quot; standing alone is a great pivot-point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this immensely - the writing is really strong and the imagery is very well expressed. I did not see the twist coming but in hindsight it is very nicely supported by the detachment and the whole first-person-commentary-continues-after-death thing. It&#039;s a fun read and so appropriate for Christmas! ;)

I would swing Elemental&#039;s way on desperate - I&#039;d prefer a lower emotional knock there.

In &quot;I swear I see the demon...&quot; I would play around with leaving out the &quot;I swear&quot; for a cleaner sentence.

The last ellipsis is not ideal for me. It could work with just a full stop, or moving the last sentence into its own paragraph - but it&#039;s a minor quibble.

Lots of great turns of phrase:

&quot;The wire is white hot, but the wounds donâ€™t cauterise.&quot;
&quot;Sweat trickles into the cuts and stings like acid.&quot;
&quot;...he pulls back his rippling arm and brings it down on my face with enough force to tear my head from my shoulders.&quot;

Yummy :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was quirky and unexpected and pleasingly evil minded - I love the switch from victim to corporate quality control. For this reason I disagree with elementalsystems about the &quot;desperate scream&quot; - it works well for me as being absolutely in paradigm for that moment of transferred consciousness.

I also liked the writing - muscular and restrained, with a curious and completely appropriate detachment from the torture. Cool stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[good clean fun... I enjoyed this; nice idea with cool descriptions.

I enjoyed the bit about &#039;I see the demon tremble a little&#039; as strange and odd. Also liked the bureaucratic everyday tone towards the end.   

Great imagery esp like &#039; ...tear my head from my shoulders&#039; as a Dante-ish idea. Enjoyed the idea of the demon preferring a sharp suit to his traditional form.

Some small issues: &#039;...as he plods toward the corpse at his feet ...&#039; is supposed to refer to the narrator (kind of alive) or a different corpse?

&#039;I let out a desperate scream as &#039; - I would prefer not to have the desperate in here as it seems to contradict the later twist - perhaps remove or &#039;I let out my best scream...&#039;]]></description>
