		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;m not sure - you can&#039;t let people know they are being controlled, or rather, you can&#039;t let them [not just the masses] realise they are being pushed into specific thought patterns and to give attention to topics that are being used to hide other things that are possibly more important.  Or that require no attention at all.  

The piece wasn&#039;t about any one thing but rather a repeated action taken again and again for the purpose of a few.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool idea - like the interpretation of the theme. 

This was great: &#039;a frenzy of frothy mouths and flickering fingers&#039; - I love to hate those horrendous whoring media morons.

Makes me uncomfortable how stupid and predictable the &#039;masses&#039; are - but I suppose that is your point.

Perhaps I would prefer it if the last line was: &#039;Controlling the masses was NOT such a subtle art&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the deadline was this weekend coming not the one just past so was caught with a half idea and no actual content.  There is so much work that needs to be done on this.

I think I might have to upgrade from my pen and paper calendar to one that sends me emails about dates.  At least until my mind is organised again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(GoogleGoogleGoogle)

No, we shan&#039;t have you executed, late though you are! 

I liked this vignette on crowd control. I have a few suggestions:

insight should be incite
Though some of the more suspicious ones may ‘theorise’ but they were only good for a laugh. - this is a little odd in reading, I would have preferred &quot;but those theories were only good for a laugh&quot;. I&#039;m also a little unsure of the inverted commas around &quot;theorise&quot;?
The sentence starting with &quot;happily&quot; turns speculative (&quot;would&quot;) which is disorienting in time and space - the riot did happen, so they did turn ugly if you see what I mean.

To ground the piece, suggest you consider adding a little detail - what actually happened? Where was this riot? what about? Who hit who first? A few items like this make the story more real for me.

But nice concept and it sketches out a good conspiracy!]]></description>
