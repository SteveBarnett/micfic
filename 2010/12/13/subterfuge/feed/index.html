		<description><![CDATA[Never apologise for rubbish-ness - if everyone started doing this the internet would run out of space.

Cool story - another comovedy future: still filled with deceit, dishonesty and joyous frippery; the future according to Dickens

Like the idea of the procedure (as little described as it is) and the idea of the double subterfuge within - the fraudsters trying to steal money by deceit and the client trying to steal IP by deceit.

Certainly the second twist took me by surprise. Good cool fun - I would have liked to see more about exactly what the service being sold was - perhaps the text of the classified advert might have been great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apologies accepted, except the last one, because unnecessary.

I really liked this piece! I love the straight take on &quot;subterfuge&quot; followed by a twist and a double-twist - that was fun and quick and lightfooted, very clever! 

I especially like that the nature of the procedure is not revealed at all, it works your imagination and also fits the theme - none of the characters are really interested in what the procedure does either, only how it&#039;s done (and how much to charge for it!).

I think this is great, and fits into my general vision of comovedy-future - quick, strange and commercially viable ;)

thank you!]]></description>
