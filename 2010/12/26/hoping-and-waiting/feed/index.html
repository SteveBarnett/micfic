		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this a lot. It is full of secret meaning (like the alabaster mask). I love that the narrator alludes to her very different past with Gabriel without describing it much - I like the way this is told through the scars.

The setting is beautiful, but made me wonder where she was. They don&#039;t speak english here and live in a village, which made it feel African. But there is a frozen lake, which is colder and people drink wine in carafes which doesn&#039;t feel like a village in Africa. It led to some interesting musings, not an unpleasant thing :-)

I really like the emotional tone of the narrator, her stillness and acceptance are lovely and feel a little buddist, which is beautifully contrasted with her association with the Pariah.

It is a great teaser, I find myself waiting with her for the Pariah to arrive :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very intriguing. I loved the contrast between elements of older societies (masks, magic and mysticism) and modernity. Also thought an arch-typical story (siblings with old conflict are meeting again with possible tragic consequences) worked well in the rather odd setting.

I loved your description of the summer days and the unspecified but really creepy idea that the brother is around somewhere near but hasn&#039;t quite shown himself.

I think the &#039;barely told&#039; style worked well here - I was confused and curious in a good way.

Not too keen on the end for several reasons. &#039;Gabriel&#039; is only mentioned here and seems distracting; she seems lonely and nostalgic and hoping for reconciliation - yet revenge seems the only outcome she considers; the whole tone of the &#039;I hope...&#039; bits seems at odds with the patient waiting in a beautiful place for one&#039;s (expected/deserved) doom. 

Ending aside I thought it worked really well overall - intriguing and interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that you&#039;ve pretty much understood the story as it&#039;s been explained :) The main link to the theme is that the brother can destroy the village in flames, which may not be the strongest link in the world, but it&#039;s there!  

As to the singular: you&#039;re possibly right! I often use &quot;their&quot; in the singular and it&#039;s confusing matters in the sentence. Bah. On the plus side, it doesn&#039;t parse wrong to me when I read it. 

Thanks for the positive comments :) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, dear, this is all my fault then? ;)

I found this one fascinating but very obscure. I will try and tell you what I think is happening, Rudy-style:

This is a story about a woman who has once lived in [big cities/Western world/the reality we know] but is now in some sort of exile [far from civilisation/in another reality]. She lives in a small village by the shores of a lake, and has a rural existence that is very different from her [mystical/ritualistic] past. Now someone - her brother, a Pariah, a highly feared/respected/mysterious figure - has come to the village, to find her, she hopes. The Pariah is there but she has not seen him, others have, he is dangerous and the implication is that the Hero used to be equally dangerous (she gave him his scars). She is expecting him to [kill her/show her his scars/something else?]. She waits for him but he does not come.

I am slightly on the uncomfortable side of confused with this one - I kept feeling that I would like to know just a smidgeon more to be able to put some of it in place. But, given my last piece, I have no right to demand clarity!

I have some additional comments:

*&quot;people sit on rocking chairs overlooking the waters, a hand-rolled cigarette hanging from their lips and a carafe of wine beside them&quot; - I had a problem with the singular cigarette and carafe here. I would have preferred &quot;people sit on rocking chairs overlooking the waters, hand-rolled cigarettes hanging from their lips and carafes of wine beside them&quot;

*Until the mention of husband, I felt the main character was male, so there was a jolt at that point

*not sure of the link to the theme 

However, the imagery of the Pariah is intense and scary and full of hidden myth, and it works really well. I would like to read a longer version that gives me just that little extra context!]]></description>
