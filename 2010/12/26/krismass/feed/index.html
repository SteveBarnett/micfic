		<description><![CDATA[Quite the timely topic :) Personally, I enjoy your idea of moulding Christmas to suite our own ends. Perhaps that&#039;s what we&#039;re already beginning to do.

I enjoyed the careful threading of the SF elements through the story. And how it allows you to step back and talk about the holiday free of religious overtones. Very nice.

The only bit that I wondered about, was the last sentence, and &quot;but it makes you think&quot;. The piece had already made me think, and this bit  felt to me a bit too self-conscious. It stood out. But it&#039;s a minor problem.

Thanks for the piece.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the ideas here and the subtle sci-fi elements that slowly emerge. Especially like the multiple suns and although the re-spelling of Christmas originally annoyed me I came to appreciate it on the second reading.

Love your third paragraph, it enforces the sci-fi ideas while bringing a great sense of commonality between our xmas experiences and theirs.

Interesting and thoughtful towards the end if not as pacy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very clever - half science fiction, half philosophy. With each reading, I have picked up more of the science fiction vibes - at first I thought it was just musings on Xmas in SA, then I picked up on the funny spelling of the word and that the writer really did not know the background to the festivities, and last reading I finally got &quot;each sun&quot; which finally made it all click properly. 

But as a result, I have seen this as a contemporary &quot;Xmas in southern hemisphere&quot;, then as a &quot;Xmas in southern hemisphere in far future&quot; and then as &quot;Xmas in far future on another planet&quot;. And they all worked - because the story is about what Xmas is turning into, and the stripping of traditions to their bare bones, and that is very relevant in all scenarios.

Clever, and deceptively simple. I enjoyed it.

Thanks!]]></description>
