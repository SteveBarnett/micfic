		<description><![CDATA[I tend to agree that you don&#039;t quite have the space here to give the detail that the topic, in its nasty twistiness, actually deserves - the character&#039;s desperation, and the conflicts created by the scenario, cried out for development. But the dystopian feel is effective, lots of blood and grit and grime, and it&#039;s a lovely example of the classic setting and event being reinterpreted with a rather savage edge. &quot;Smears on the cracked tarmac&quot; - eeeuw. But punchy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, man.
Glad that the horribleness came across. That desperation was very much what I was going for.

Also: I think I may have to print myself a tshirt that says &quot;Horriblest. World. Ever.&quot; on it. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loved the way you evoked the horriblest world ever without really telling us much about it. 
I love the way he feels bad and pays respect. It is more ugly than having no moral feelings, instead he and his world have a moral sense but are too desperate do use it for anything but guilt.
The strong parallels to horse racing really work (cages + names etc)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, dude!

His Sure Thing is indeed the red hot tip (ahem).

Re rest of the world: dirty and fucked up.
Note to self: must try for brighter, happier, piece next!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have liked to add more details. Grumbling belly, clothes stitched together for the fifth time, everything falling apart. Alas, no space!

Re guilt clash: yeah, agreed. A bit too shiny happy guilty.

		<description><![CDATA[Re ReTV: tee hee! :)

Re guilt: my idea was that the sport was established, but still a bit dodgy / frowned upon, and that Thom boy was turning to it a last, desperate, resort. Certainly none of the other betterers felt guilty. Just grumpy when they lost.

Rereading this now, I&#039;m not really that happy with it.
Meh.
I shall do better with the next one!
:D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero, who&#039;s in need of a bit of cash, goes down to the &quot;tracks&quot; to make a bet. He has a tip (his sure thing, I suppose), and puts money on a person who&#039;s forced to run around the track.

I&#039;m amused: what came to mind for me with the topic was also racing of sorts :P

Nice piece. I enjoyed the description of Thomas watching the game (with his tight grip) and then, as a sign of respect, watching their slaughter as well. Both say something about the character, and one is distinctly macabre :) 

The whole story left me wondering what the rest of the world is like.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thoroughly enjoyed this. We have in fact watched Running Man in the last week, and it was beautifully reminiscent. I like the way it combines a fairly typical scene of betting on a race (it mattering a lot, having a tip and being uncertain) with the sci-fi edge of human racers.  I also like the way that the differences from a typical scene were slowly revealed: the chip in his hand, then the bloodied racers, then the fact that they are human.

I liked the guilt - it made it all feel more real and grubby to me. But it did clash slightly with Thomas&#039; smile and eagerness at the end. If he felt a little guilty, I would have liked a little hesitation at the end.]]></description>
