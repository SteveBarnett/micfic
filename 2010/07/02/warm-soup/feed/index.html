		<description><![CDATA[This is about a soldier, Falcon, sitting on a battlefield after the battle has ended, contemplating their meagre food situation. He begins to think about the dead bodies laying on the field, and the waste of fresh meat that is.

I love the twist to the macabre at the end, and how it&#039;s merely left as a potential, just a thought in Falcon&#039;s mind :) Quite lovely. Reminds me of that Rugby team that crashed in the Andes :-/

I also enjoyed the description of the soup, being boiled roots and twigs. It gives a feeling that they&#039;ve pushed really hard and overreached, now they&#039;re living with the outcomes of that. 

That&#039;s a fun piece. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it builds nicely from peaceful to desperate. I like these kinds of behind-the-scenes-in-Fantasyland stories a lot. Possibly could have built up the horribleness of that twigs-and-roots soup more with more description? 

Another slight crit - I wouldn&#039;t have used an established name like &quot;Elysium&quot; for Heaven - for me, it doesn&#039;t work with the name &quot;Falcon&quot; which is more fantasy-like.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the lead into the cannibalism remark. The physical stage and Falcon&#039;s mental state are well described. I could easily imagine the awful gruel that they were having to eat and the awful surroundings. 

I would have liked the cannibalism to be a little more obvious - perhaps it could be clearer how close Falcon is to this option. ]]></description>
