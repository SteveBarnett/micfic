		<description><![CDATA[Lovely.
Very sweet story and great use of the theme.

I really enjoyed the mechanic - the telling of the two bits interwoven.
Very tricky thing to do in such a tight space, but it you&#039;ve really cranked that sucker out. If you see what I mean...
And having it all dialogue and still getting all the facts across - ace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a odd romance tale told through two different strands of dialogue. Our hero arrives on a planet, peddling goods, and gets involved with some biomass thingy (the Soup). They both run off, having broken some laws (killed someone?) and stealing the peddler&#039;s ship.

This made me smile :) It&#039;s part romantic comedy, part science fiction. I enjoy how it was all done with only dialogue, including the description of them being wanted individuals. We get a feel for the Soup in only 2-4 short lines of dialogue (not sure who speaks two of the lines, though), which is great.

It wasn&#039;t immediately clear to me that the italicized dialogue was between two people, rather than the thoughts of one person. The last set of italicized text does make it clear, though. Also, after having re-read this a number of times, I&#039;m still not completely sure who speaks each line of italicised text. But that didn&#039;t take away from the fun of reading this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely idea and I like the minimalistic telling of the romance. I don&#039;t mind the confusion over who is speaking as it reflects the &#039;selling voice&#039; rather well. Also like the mix of the voices (corporate-speak + nostalgic romance) a lot - wish I had an alternate suggestion for the layout as the dashes + italics + spacing annoy me but I&#039;m not sure what would be better

Love the way we never know exactly what they did together that was illegal (and how bad it was). 

I also thought the last paragraph was a bit flat and confusing in terms of ocean sized lover and stolen ship. I could have done without it.

Brilliant idea, cool writing - and I&#039;m theme inspired ... &quot;Alien love&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also thought this was lovely. So strange and unusual and beautiful. As docinatrix says, you flesh out a lot of personality, a fairly hard scifi exposition and a love story in so few words! 

The first interchange is also not clear to me. The piece was most coherent and beautiful to me on about the third read, which I needed to understand the various voices. But I like that subtlety, so not sure this is a crit exactly...

I also had some minor reality-check moments with the last paragraph. If the pilot stole the ship, then how did s/he get into the soup? Also, I was picturing the soup as taking up the entire ocean of the planet, so had issues with it fitting into a spaceship.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this. Lovelovelove it. It&#039;s a truly demented and off-the-wall romance told with enormous elegance - the conversation/asides format works incredibly well, and you pack huge amounts of personality into the three characters involved - the lover, the Soup and the corporate presence. I was rooting for the romance less than halfway through, mostly, I think, because the italicised/nostalgic bit creates it as a done deal, a mature/reflective relationship looking back.

Incredibly minor quibble: who&#039;s speaking isn&#039;t quite clear in the first interchange, I had to read it several times. I&#039;d suggest the very simple addition of an ellipsis after &quot;please sign here&quot;, so the dialogue alternation is maintained. If that is, in fact, what you meant in those first three lines. I&#039;ve had a long week full of minutes.

Have a lovely holiday!]]></description>
