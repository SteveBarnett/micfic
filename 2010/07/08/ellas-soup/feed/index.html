		<description><![CDATA[I really liked this.
Soft without being mushy and heart-warming without being soppy.

I think I agree re last paragraph, but only because it contrasts with the fairly matter-of-fact-ness of the others.

Made me sniffle a little bit... *blink*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is about James&#039;s mourning and remembrance of Ella, his wife. As he remembers a soup that he makes in her memory we see some past moments that they&#039;ve shared together.

I thought this was a sweet piece. I like how, as Andrew said, it avoids despair. Rather, it focuses on the good things they enjoyed together — I think it better brings out the sadness, because it highlights what they&#039;ve now lost.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like this. I like how it invokes sadness without ever mentioning anything explicitly (no tears, no despair and no direct descriptions of what James is feeling). I think the short, sweet, factual sentences work to make this nostalgic romance feel real world.

Love the metaphors apparent with all the soup ingredients especially the tomato and chicken stock comments.
&#039;She never missed a year&#039; - is a great sentence loaded with unpretentious pathos.

Not totally sure about the last paragraph, it is the most smalshy romantic bit - but I think it works.]]></description>
