		<description><![CDATA[This is a story in which roles have been reversed: the children having the story told to them are who are usually considered monsters, while the actual monster in the story is the person usually considered the hero.

This was fun. I enjoy it when roles are twisted around as they are here. It also gives you a chance to play with perceptions, such as with &quot;as the sun started to rise&quot;. I&#039;m unsure about the last sentence, and think that the story could work without it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the twist and I like the language - good, dark world, festered and unmentionable! (That sentence is very well phrased).

The twist is very &quot;I am legend&quot; - but from the other point of view. Thank you!]]></description>
