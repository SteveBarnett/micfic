		<description><![CDATA[Great work.
The concept is ace, and your delivery is very nicely paced.

My favourite bit is the twenty four / Black ingredient section.
Makes the whole thing nicely rounded.

Not sure I like the (content of the) quote in P1, but that&#039;s just me being fussy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is about a country&#039;s president sitting down to have a meal of a communally produced soup. The soup represents the nation&#039;s feelings towards the president, and we learn the mechanics of this from the president&#039;s memories. If the nation doesn&#039;t like president, they&#039;re perfectly able to poison the soup. The president then settles down in an attempt to enjoy the bisque that he has been served.

I enjoy both the idea of people having a direct say in how they feel their head of state is performing, and also the ceremony of it all. It&#039;s fun to hear it playing out with the death of a former president.

One minor nit no one else has mentioned: I&#039;m unsure about some of the semi-colons, and think that they could be better as colons. For example:

&#062; I know I won’t enjoy the soup no matter the outcome[:] I never liked
&#062; lobster bisque

and

&#062; This bisque was made by a million hands[:] a gift of sorts]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I get the sense that this isn&#039;t the first time he&#039;s eaten this dish? Lovely worldbuilding, I liked the &quot;thin grey broth&quot;, it gives this distopian feel without laying it on thick. Also, the black/white thing recalls the roots of democracy in Greece, was that deliberate?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oooh, loved this. Literalisation of democratic process ftw. Also a bit of slightly nasty wishful thinking about corrupt politicians. This was elegantly done, with the specificity of the lobster bisque adding a lot of immediacy to the abstract idea.

I have slightly problems with your tenses in the second paragraph; the selecting of ingredients for &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; soup seem to me to need to be in present, rather than past tense, or they collide a bit with the subsequent history of the unlamented Grate. Thus: &quot;This bisque was made by a million hands; a gift of sorts from each one of the citizens I have led these past two years. This week each of them has gone to a station and selected an ingredient for this soup; now, on live television, they will see the outcome.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the idea behind this, and it is beautifully expounded. I like the way you initially focus on the more mundane aspects of the soup (not the lobster bisque is a mundane soup!) and then slowly unveil its more symbolic aspects. 

I like paragraphs three and four the most. The description of black and white ingredients is powerful and compelling, and taking us back to the main character&#039;s youth when he did what millions are doing to him is a lovely juxtaposition. And then it all becomes completely clear in paragraph four. I especially enjoyed the simplicity of the first sentence of this paragraph.

I have some criticisms. I would have capitalised the White as well as the Black for consistency. Also, I would have preferred it to be powder, like the Black, rather than flour. 
I would have used &quot;have&quot; or &quot;has&quot; rather than &quot;had&quot; in the last two sentences of paragraph 2.]]></description>
