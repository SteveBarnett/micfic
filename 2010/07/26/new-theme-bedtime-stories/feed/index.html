Could the length be given with the theme so I don&#039;t forget?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am nervous, but interested in playing with different word limits, but would not like to do parallel sessions. My creative energies might implode - they&#039;re not used to being exercised this much. 

I also like the idea of putting themes into volumes. It will certainly get confusing the longer the right panel gets.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Groovy. so we&#039;re somewhat agreed in principle that different limits are good, now we just need to haggle on how much and when.

Yes!
Please to do next Theme.
Thanking you, please.

		<description><![CDATA[Weird, didn&#039;t read this before I suggested an occasional longer challenge on another post. I think it&#039;s going to be quite easy to slide into 250 words as a too-familiar constraint that might overly shape our writing over time - it&#039;ll stretch us nicely to look at different limits occasionally.

I haven&#039;t done a theme yet, can I do the next one?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am for a word limit mix up (but easy does it). Don&#039;t think I am prepared to commit more time at the moment so a parallel project is not so good.

Options:
a) 1 in 4 is 500-600 words normal fortnight submission
b) 1 in 4 runs for double time (4 weeks) with 2 themes - 1 nano-fiction (&#060;50 words or the like) and the other longer  (say 500 words)

On the other hand this is a difficult thing we are doing, and if it ain&#039;t yet broke I&#039;m hesitate to fix it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, who&#039;s up for Theme the next?

People seem to be having awesome, big, ideas for lots of the themes.
Perhaps it&#039;s time we started thinking about word limits.
I&#039;m very happy with the short form, but maybe we could do a longer story one in every four? Or a parallel project of sorts?
Any thoughts, folks?]]></description>
