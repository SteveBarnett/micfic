		<description><![CDATA[This is a piece seen from two different viewpoints: someone travelling through space, informing us of the sure things which they depend on; and someone waiting for their lover to return.

I like how the two viewpoints compliment each other â€” it&#039;s quite touching. I also enjoy the phrase, &quot;the long dark.&quot; Very evocative :) /]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the two perspectives and generally enjoy sci-fi which is human driven like this. Would never have thought you were battling for length as the two pieces seem to dovetail so well.

fearlessly romantic - I like that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with cbraz - very beautiful and poetic, and the two voices and themes match up very well. I like the sense of longing and loving and loneliness it evokes. 

I also found this theme very hard for some reason!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you :)  I had a lot of trouble with this theme, truth be told.  Or rather, trying for 250 words with this theme.  I kept coming up with about 100 or 120.  But I&#039;m glad I finally figured something out and I am pleased with the result.  Double bonus.]]></description>
