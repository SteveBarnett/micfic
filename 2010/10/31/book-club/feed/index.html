		<description><![CDATA[The first paragraph is a great scene setter, with some lovely touches, particularly &quot;lashings of creamy butter and tart jam.&quot; I definitely got a Miss Marpley period feeling from it.

I really dug the &quot;When they had dispensed&quot; paragraph with the little snippest of conversation. Great gossip stylings, very classic.

The menace of the last paragraph is very creepy, and well written.
Sounds like lots of people I have met (and then avoided!).

The Book Club as Social Weapon is a well documented real world phenomenon (eek!), and you&#039;ve done an ace job of painting a picture of it here. Really enjoyed this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am the happy possessor of the entire Ngaio Marsh collection, which are arranged in my detective fiction shelves in strict chronological order. Also, all of Sayers and almost all of Allingham, ditto, except I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve arranged them chronologically. Please consider yourself to have a standing invitation to come over and raid for reading matter. If you haven&#039;t yet met Lord Peter Wimsey or Albert Campion, you darned well should, and I have a soft spot for Roderick Alleyn and his artist wife. Some of the Ngaio Marsh country house ones are basically LARPs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I do in fact thoroughly enjoy this sort of reading. I especially love and regularly devour Agatha Christie and Georgette Heyer for light escapist reading. I was completely thinking of Miss Marple in this piece, and am very happy that you saw it :-) 

I hadn&#039;t heard of Ngaio Marsh before. I googled her and found on wikipedia about the four Queens of Crime (also Dorothy Sayers and Marjory Allingham), of whom I have only read Christie. Thanks very much for the name - I&#039;m excited about the slew of authors opened up for me :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you enjoyed the maliciousness. I enjoyed writing it, and playing with the busybody-ness of the character :-) I also really enjoyed writing about the tea - its the bit that got the rest flowing for me oddly enough (I was channeling Enid Blyton for that bit - my memory of her descriptions of packed lunches for the Famous 5 still makes my mouth water).

About the two bits of dialogue, I didn&#039;t really assign characters to any except the last, which was May&#039;s. I wanted a vibe that no-one would really remember later who had said what exactly.  

That&#039;s funny and odd-feeling about the Upper Westing google result. Cool :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the way so many of your pieces have a slightly period feel - this one says Miss Marple or Ngaio Marsh to me, do you enjoy that sort of vintage of reading? or am I projecting my own reading tastes :&#062;?

The detail here was lovely, it created the setting in a precise, slightly fussy way deeply appropriate to the small-minded concerns of the book club ladies. The relish in the sensual description of the tea also very nicely foreshadows the relish with which they bite into the gossip. This was a lovely vignette, thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, this is perfectly pitched - the vindictive tones, the small-scale evil plotting - this is the kind of woman who&#039;d have been an evil overlord in different circumstances! 

I like the delicate upper class tones, the subtleness of the rumours, the cunning negation (it&#039;s just a rumour, nothing to it) that makes the gossip even more appealing. Very well caught.

I agree that while the slight was, well, slight, given May&#039;s small world it looks very big to her.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is about a bookclub getting together and talking about the various residents of Upper Westing. May begins to spread rumours about their newest resident in an attempt to make his life unpleasant. The reason for this is that he had called her a busybody, and she wants revenge for the slight.

I was amused that her revenge is essentially taking the form of being a &quot;busybody&quot;. Her self-righteous maliciousness is quite excellent.  

&#062; There were also several teas, infusions and home-made lemonade.
I loved this sentence, mostly because of the word &quot;infusions&quot;. I think it adds a lot to the description in a &quot;Oh, I wouldn&#039;t have thought of that&quot; kind of way.

I was wondering if the two bits of dialogue beginning &quot;My Tom knows...&quot; and &quot;I heard he was...&quot; are spoken by the same person (I presume May). They both seem to by implicating the new resident in the same way. 

Also, I just googled to see if Upper Westing is a real place, and the top hit was this micfic site ;)]]></description>
