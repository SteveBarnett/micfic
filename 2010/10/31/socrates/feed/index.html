		<description><![CDATA[Flickr! Time for another batch of pictures! 

I&#039;m glad you liked the story ;) And no, don&#039;t think we ever spoke about good ol&#039; Socrates in a pub. I&#039;m also glad that you didn&#039;t mind the contractions, even if it was only on your first reading. But I think you might be in a minority :( ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[ Social contract? Are we talking about Flickr again? ;) ]

I also don&#039;t know the story (was in the pub that day?), but really enjoyed your take on it.

+1 for the great formal, archaic language.
Rereading it now, I spot the contractions and more modern turns of phrase as standing out and breaking the flow ever so slightly. On the first few reads I didn&#039;t notice at all though: I think that the archaic stands out and I noticed it, whereas the modern didn&#039;t hit any filters, so didn&#039;t set out any alarms. If that makes any sense.

Also +1 to the &quot;That when he came...&quot; paragraph being great, and very well constructed.

Great language, voice, and Philosomaphisers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the voice, as did everyone else too! I thought it almost biblical at times (&quot;the exit of that place&quot; for example) which is probably exactly right for the period (even though this is philosophy, not religion). Sadly, I don&#039;t know the actual story very well (slept through my classics), so I don&#039;t know how it ends (although the hint at &quot;execution&quot; is ominous).

Great storytelling, thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely idea, to rewrite a famous old story which puts faces and characters to the details of the past. I like the way you don&#039;t mention any of the famous details, like the hemlock and the charges, but expect the reader to know them. It gives the piece a secret, rarefied quality. 

I particularly enjoyed Crito&#039;s description of Socrates&#039; reasoning (&quot;That when he came to this City ... answered with injustice.&quot;) That whole paragraph is beautifully put together and the sentiments in it are subtly and cleverly expressed.

I really like the formal, archaic language that you use. In general, you carry it beautifully across the whole piece. There are a couple of places I felt that modern language crept in, e.g. &quot;I’m so glad to see you.&quot;, &quot;Let’s go.&quot; and &quot;... than everyone else.&quot;]]></description>
