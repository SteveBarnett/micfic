		<description><![CDATA[Um. I love the layout of the swirly ones, but those particular borders scream &quot;standard Windows borders&quot; to me. (Are they standard Windows borders? where have I seen them before?). They&#039;re classy and Victorian and everything, but horribly over-familiar. Either that, or I&#039;m hallucinating.]]></description>

Swirls contain Win: scientific FacT.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with elementalsystems somewhat:

- I really like both the swirly designs and the card designs (not the blue one), but I think I come out in favour of swirly. I like the victorian-ness of the swirly ones and the amount of information that they provide.The card backs are harder to parse, but will be easier to put together as they don&#039;t change for every writer, just for every theme.
- I don&#039;t mind about the names, and quite like the fact that the swirly cards have both nicks and names on them.]]></description>

I heart ornaments.
I&#039;m going to have a bit more of a play with this kind of style...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like your ornamented+highlighted+swirly backings, especially the first of the pair that you&#039;ve got. It&#039;s a contents page, and also tells you what you&#039;re reading :) It also makes all of the cards consistent with each other, but slightly different as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If we are going to have title and author on the back side (the current consensus)  then I think the title and author can be on the front or not depending on the card - seems really right for most of the stuff but might be cooler without for specific entries (consider the Dear John Letter and Gold-E)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! :)
See previous comment re Stuff and the stuffing thereof.

I&#039;m beginning to think just real names. I agree with your screen name comments.

I don&#039;t see why the artwork attribution can&#039;t go on the back with the other info, but I do really like the idea of a table of contents type thing (without the bother of page numbers. ahem.). I shall have a go at banging this together.

I&#039;ve been assuming that we have &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; back design. This stems from my original idea of the playing card vibes. Jo&#039;s been assuming one per Theme. I think one per card is not going to be possible given time / sanity constraints. So, one for all and all for one, or one per Theme?

I&#039;ll have a bit of a play and see what else I can come up with in the swirly-type stuff category.]]></description>
