		<description><![CDATA[Really good stuff parfles. I love these all (the soup the least).
I like the stv idea of all the titles and one highlighted in general.
I do feel that the purpose of the backs in to unite the set (as opposed to the fronts we want all different) so I think we should try to keep them somewhat similar and in that spirit I think if we want to go this way we should stick to a basic colour scheme (like the mostly black, white and some red) and style.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aargh. The more you lot post this sort of thing, the more I realise that I am not a visual person. These are completely stunning. I wish to subscribe to their newsletter. I shall slink back to my word-based den, conscious of my inadequacy.

I have minor niggles with these, mostly along the lines of the amount of info (I don&#039;t think all the story titles are necessary), but they&#039;re minor. I love these. Please can we use them?]]></description>
