		<description><![CDATA[My main concern is that they are very strong images which, while very cool, may not be appropriate to all the stories in a theme. An example in the current selection is the soup picture, which I think has a very different feeling to my story. While I do not mind (and in fact like the idea of) parfles&#039; images as separators, ideally I would prefer not to have a strong image so opposed to my story on the back of its card.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My vote - Parf for separators - tri-coloured minimilism for the win

Stv for backs

While I am deeply enamoured with the newer large font-based designs I wonder how similar they will actually look given the different lengths of text required on each (&#039;Death of an Ornithologist&#039; vs &#039;Pain&#039; and elementalsystems vs parfles) [seems it&#039;s just me with the long names - occupational hazard?]

So my backs vote is still on stv&#039;s initial posting - the ones above the playing cards. Feel this is a good compromise. 

However I am open to almost all the other options.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see this. They are graphically very stark, but why should that interfere? you don&#039;t look at the back and the front side-by-side, by definition. Of course, there&#039;s a clear and present danger they&#039;ll completely &lt;i&gt;outclass&lt;/i&gt; anything done by, for example, me, on the actual stories, but I&#039;m down with that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I think they are lovely, I share parfles&#039; concern about her backs. My vote would not be to have them as backs, but I really like the idea of using them as divisors - that also works well with having the story titles on them - they could act as a mini-contents for each theme.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would be super flattered if I was to be asked to do more, and I would do them, do them I would!

I am slightly concerned that the backs are graphically very stark and may interfere with the fronts - I think ES said this somewhere, possibly in non-electronic format (gasp!)

Alternative is to use them as divisors for each theme?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a vital question to ask before I can follow cbraz&#039;s suggestion and vote. Parfles, are you up for creating the rest of the series, given that you&#039;ve only done three? if not, is anyone up for creating more in the same style? I am very, very enamoured of them, but they&#039;re not much use if we only have three out of seven.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have a lot of really good options for the backs, and it might be difficult to agree on the the final one idea that we use. I suggest that we all provide our top three options in order (because I am not sure a top one is going to result in a clear choice), and we combine those to find the one that is most agreed on.]]></description>
