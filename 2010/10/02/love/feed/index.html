		<description><![CDATA[This is powerful writing, and very good character insight. (Scarily good!!! :)

My main criticism is that I feel the connection to the theme is too weak. I did not get it at all, and I kept trying to figure if one of the characters was a ghost, which distracted me. When I found the answer in the comments, I still did not feel it really spoke to the theme. 

I think this is because if we are talking about ghost in that sense, the shadow sense, then the confrontational tone of the last paragraph or two is out of character for me - this is not a protagonist that is silently shadowing like a ghost, he is actively trying to get involved in his target&#039;s life.

That aside, it is a strong story in its own right, regardless of theme. thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was powerful, obsessive and emotionally intense. I really enjoyed it and it rang true for me all the way through. I particularly enjoyed the focus on detail: his movie role and the tie interaction in the first paragraph, having coffee in the second. I also enjoyed the descriptions of misreading signals - we all do it to some extent (read things into actions or don&#039;t see what signals are telling us), so it was interesting to read an extreme of that.

Like Doc I am unsure about the Ghost connection. My preconceptions based on the theme misled me a little, which made my first reading a little confused. But then I understood and re-read it and it all fell into place.

Also, while I enjoyed the hitting bit and the stalker&#039;s reaction, I thought the actor&#039;s reaction to the stalker was a bit extreme as we hadn&#039;t had any history of repeated meetings. I wanted some history to justify the physical violence or more description of how the actor was provoked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the ghost link might have been with the wife [I got the impression the stalker was going to kill her] but I think comovedy has it - shadowing.  

I really enjoyed the misinterpretations, I think it gave the stalker credibility in his insanity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[Ghost as in shadowing someone, yes?]

Liked this a lot.
You&#039;ve got the creepy stalker voice down pat.
Which would be kinda scary if I didn&#039;t know that you are actually a very nice guy ;).
The rationalisations / misinterpretation of the stalkee&#039;s actions are great.

Really enjoyed the shouting and beating paragraph.
&#062; The feeling of his clenched, taut fists hitting me â€” God. Oh God.
was especially good.

A bit crazy, but well written!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely sense of the obsessive private world of an unhinged stalker - the self-justifications and entirely narcissistic viewpoint ring very true, and are both sad and disturbing. The build-up to the broken-off response to the actual physical contact is very powerful. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m being end-of-week obtuse, though, I&#039;m not sure how you got to this from the theme - ghost of what, or whom? The speaker is the ghost in the actor&#039;s life? It doesn&#039;t quite gel for me, but as I say, I may be missing something obvious. But I enjoyed this, thank you.]]></description>
