		<description><![CDATA[I like this a lot, even though it felt a bit nasty.
The interaction between the two is finely played.

+1 for &quot;His is the voice...&quot; being very nicely written.
Also enjoyed the bookends.

I liked the delicate handling of the crash, too.
Nothing too explosive, just a more clinical, hindsight-y description.

I will henceforth be using the word thrup for colliding things.
It is good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a good idea and well followed through, with the outsider being a much more interesting personality than the main character - a meta personality that is more concerned with narrative than real consequences. 

The voice of this one however felt strange to me - I could somehow never quite buy it. I think my impression was that of someone being a little pretentious about themselves - it felt like someone who was making themselves sound more interesting by making up an inner life. I think that&#039;s just my reading of the tone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I enjoyed most was how the Outsider had a distant, detached voice when commenting on the accident, and how this contrasts with the Narrator&#039;s discussion of it, which is also somewhat distant (although it leans towards joyousness). I enjoyed the description in the whole of the second paragraph as well. 

I have some nitpicks:

Some of the diacritics on &quot;naïveté&quot; were left off. I think that they should either be all off or all on, and it&#039;s better to leave 

For the dialogue: I would have placed the final fullstop inside the dialogue itself:
&#062; “You were driving too fast; pretty stupid[.]”
I&#039;d do this as well for the dialogue followed by parentheses, and because the parentheses will now longer be inside a sentence, stick the fullstop inside of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, glad you liked the child voice/old man voice sentence I almost deleted it due to pretentiousness.

Unaffected by me... I see you point - always thought the informal &#039;shit that happens&#039; would be people&#039;s problems with this sentence - interesting.

Hear vs heard - yep indeed you are right - I tried it first in present and then (incompletely apparently) changed it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this. It is a beautifully crafted insight into an inner voice, which I know in myself and am sure most of us have at times. At first I struggled somewhat with the conception of this voice as the outsider, but on reflection really liked it - it does sometimes feel that this voice is somehow separate from one&#039;s mundane everyday self. I also really like the warmth of the characterisation, coupled with id-like comments. Often such a voice is seen as proscriptive, critical and harsh rather than warm and knowing in a slightly detached way. 

The piece is very well put together - I like the framing of beginning and end, the description of the outsider, and then the vignette which illustrates how he acts beautifully.

Some phrases that I particularly enjoyed: 
&quot;His is the voice of the lithe old man ...the voice of the curious child ..&quot; - This whole sentence is poetic and visually descriptive - very beautiful. 
&quot;by what they think or by what they say&quot; - this says so much while leaving so much unsaid, like who they are, because it doesn&#039;t matter who they are.
&quot;clipped something with a dull crunchy thrup&quot; - I love the rhythm of this sentence and the other accident descriptions. Excellent use of onomatopoeia. 

I have two crits:
In &quot;He is unaffected by me, by how I feel...&quot; I don&#039;t like the first part as it feels wrong to say he is unaffected by you; because he is always with you he at least only sees the places you go and the things you see so is affected by you. I would prefer this as &quot;He is unaffected by how I feel...&quot;.
In &quot;Just as I felt the wheels losing traction on the slick tarmac I hear his voice&quot;, I want the verb tenses to match. Since the rest is past, I would make the second verb &quot;heard&quot; rather than hear, or make the whole incident present tense.]]></description>
