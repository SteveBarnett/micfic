I am not happy with the level of confusion I have generated with this one. I have resolved to do a rewrite - it&#039;s one thing to be obscure, another to be completely muddled!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the interaction between the two characters and the ideas about ghosts and life. The present tense combined with being in Brent&#039;s thoughts, works very well. I like the way we experience Brent thinking about Reed&#039;s words, the job, and reacting to both - the scene feels uninterpreted and direct.

Like others, I&#039;m afraid that I don&#039;t quite get the numbers and wish I did. I feel like the story leaves me wanting to know too much more to be complete by itself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, this has a longish description of what I thought was happening, mostly because I thought bits of it was quite (intentionally) obscure, so I thought you&#039;d appreciate it. 

Here&#039;s my understanding of this: two engineers are working on the outside of a ship; there is at least another person inside, Jan, who appears to have been dead since the year 2109.  They&#039;re discussing travelling across large areas of space. This is presumably done after they have died. The boy, Reed, has signed up to do this, but has signed up /limited/, which seems to imply that he&#039;ll be exploring things very very soon, and since this exploration is undertaken only by dead people, he also expects to be killed within a few years time.

I still don&#039;t understand the numbers: under 5000 (like 4201) is apparently good, but the story kind of implies that Jan hasn&#039;t had it good (Reed doesn&#039;t want to be like him). But Jan is Ghost-180, which is way under 5000.

Also, one bit that left me confused, was the discussion of distances. Sixty-parsecs was mentioned, followed by 200, 220 clicks. A parsec is huge, and I thought that 200 / 220 clicks was somehow being compared to this, but a click (klick) is only a kilometer (which I suspect you probably didn&#039;t mean, but I&#039;m not sure).

Anyway, I enjoyed this piece. The dialogue was fun and left me interested and pondering the world. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice!
Ghost as space man! Very groovy.

But I don&#039;t get it.
Wait, I mean: I didn&#039;t get it.
Actually, I still don&#039;t quite get the numbers at the end.

Really enjoyed the engineer pair. Great character sketches, especially of Reed.
&quot;Thanks, guys, you’ve got a real light touch&quot; made me feel like they&#039;re a team with a good rep, have been working together a while, and get called in for the tricky jobs that other engineers can&#039;t do.
I enjoyed the working team, chatty camaraderie, vibes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting story. Enjoyed the everydayness of the far-future - the boy with his tongue sticking out his mouth and the older mentor.Also enjoyed the everyday interplay and working together vibe.

My first reading was pretty confused, the second a lot more fun (especially the re-interpretation of the first line once you know what is going on).

Even after several readings there are aspects of it which are unclear to me in a bad way: what exactly do the numbers mean (like a ship number or a date or a ghost number?) - the characters seem to get more information than me which is a little frustrating. Also I would like the rather interesting idea suggested by &#039;limited&#039; more explicitly spelt out. I would also like to know whether the Ghost are a relatively new thing or an everyday aspect of their lives.

But I suppose all the questions reflect my fascination with your world-building: Loved the ideas around being on your own for 200 years and what that would do to you and the idea around voluntary death for advantage.]]></description>
