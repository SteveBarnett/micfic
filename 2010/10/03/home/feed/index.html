		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the comments - I identify with the idea of a ghost being a fading collection of memories and obsessions, it feels right to me.

The writing is very beautiful when you talk about nature, the hills and plains and so forth. Obviously something you identify strongly with. 

The bits where you talk about the people are a bit more clumsy feeling - &quot;our first adventure as adults&quot; doesn&#039;t sound right to me. &quot;experiencing something different&quot; also doesn&#039;t feel the way people talk.

I think it will work to keep the people descriptions colourless and wan compared to the overwhelming spectacle of nature - but the phrases need more polish in that section.

Beautiful and haunting, but not scarily so - thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with ES on the sublime and lonely as opposed to scary: almost soft and gentle and sad.
The descriptions of the two places were great and the contrast was very well painted by your words.

I particularly enjoyed the vibes around being tethered to the wrong place and &quot;I cannot rest here.&quot; Works really well as motivation for the haunting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Doc. I&#039;m glad you liked it and you have it exactly right. I was thinking of the Karoo, around the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape border. And it was my choice to portray a ghost in the tradition of a reduction from complete human to one or two human qualities expressed powerfully and obsessively. On a drive recently I found myself longing for the Cape in a way that felt almost physical - it was very powerful and I wanted to capture it. Also the Karoo landscape is made for haunting stories :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this - gentle, nostalgic, with a very vivid sense of place. Are you thinking of the Karoo here? That sense of a vast, slightly alien, atmospheric landscape very much recalls it for me. 

The land itself, and the contrast with the Cape, is such a strong presence that it almost overwrites the ghost itself - I don&#039;t get a strong sense of personality or voice, it&#039;s all dominated by the longing for home. Was that a deliberate choice? Interesting, if so - follows the idea of a ghost as obsessed, reduced to one quality, here longing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed the slow reveal and constant fore-shadowing (how I came to be/wish I hadn&#039;t come) in the first paragraph and think the second serves well to create common ground and sympathy with your ghost - everyone has a first road trip.

Also your (your character&#039;s) love of the land and beauty shines through nicely; love your descriptions of and with the colours.

Enjoyed the interpretation of Ghost as sublime and lonely as opposed to scary.]]></description>
