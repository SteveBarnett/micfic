		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! :)

Why ditch the tiring? Too many commas?
I defend my plomped.
I concur with the glare.
I also concur with the slender. I didn&#039;t quite like it, but the word is so nice I had to use it. Slender. Slender. Sleeeeender.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love the dialogue, the causal tone of the piece, the voices of the characters. It is perfectly captured!

My niggles are only with little bits of text outside of the spoken parts:

Thirsty, tiring, work, this is. - I would have left out &quot;tiring&quot;
Bob plomped down - &quot;plomped&quot; sounds wrong
glared - as per other comments
pointing a pale, slender finger - &quot;slender&quot; bothers me, seems out of character for the piece!


But these are minor, and the piece is a lovely, funny thing! Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yay, thank you, cbraz!
At one point I was actually considering rewriting it so that there was no obvious physical contact with anything, but it got a bit silly...

Re completely natural: I have good source material :).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this. It was light and funny, and the interaction feels completely natural. I like the subtlety as well. When I re-read it, I noticed &quot;slid over to the vending machine&quot; and it was ghostly movement, but it was not strange to use for an alive person.

I agree about the &quot;glared&quot; comments and your solution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, man!

Re water cooler: indeed I have. Let&#039;s call it research :).

Re glared: yeah, agreed. What I actually want there is &quot;raised an eyebrow&quot; or something similar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this a lot and chuckled often.

Great voice - I see you&#039;ve spent a lot of time lolling around the water cooler with under stimulated co-grinders.Really like the interaction between the characters - they seemed very natural but still really adorable/cute.
I think the movie inclusion was a great idea - subtly suggesting the truth. I liked how the big twist is so quietly played and that it isn&#039;t at the end - the last bits about poltergeist-ing being harder work really tie back to the cubicle-cultureness.

I found - Jeff turned to him and glared. “You didn’t see the schedule?” - kind of jarring from the previous friendly banter and out of place with the rest of the casual chit-chat.]]></description>
