		<description><![CDATA[Ha! I laughed and giggled a lot when I read this. It kept me amused. I will not summarise the story, since my job here is done!

It seemed to hit a lot of things that we&#039;ve been thinking about while writing and reading these micfics â€” about personal bits that authors write about when the readers know them well enough to recognise them; and about the critting process in general: what to take from it and what to leave behind. I enjoyed how it tied it all together.

I wouldn&#039;t worry much about the gimmickyness: this was a particular story written for a particular audience, and from looking at the comments I think it went down very well (it definitely did with me).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really interesting idea and I think you made it work quiet well especially given the length limit.

 The awareness of the problems with the form (i.e. too gimmicky, too context-dependant) is really cool - but those problems do still distract.

I&#039;m not sure using the members of the group worked out that well. R&#039;s distinctive prÃ©cis was easy to associate with him and his style serves your narrative purpose extremely well. I&#039;m not sure I would have recognised the rest without the related-nicks; a relation further confused by there only being 5 comments but 6 co-writers here.

It would be very interesting to try the same idea without the known commenters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this. As others say, it is very difficult to comment without feeling self-conscious, but here goes. I think you conveyed the characters very well, with interesting connections to real people. I found a couple of the names a bit opaque - interesting to read the reasons in the comments. 

It took me a couple of reads to get the vibe, but as is often the case, that does not seem to be a bad thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome!
Very, very, clever and twisty and circular enough to avoid being gimmicky, which it could easily have been.
I think mentioning the gimmick in the story helps a lot. :)

You&#039;ve got the voices down very well and I envy your skill at this.
The &quot;not getting it&quot; may be partially my fault, as is pointed out by &quot;me&quot; in the story.
I got this one first time, though. Honest, guv!

I completely agree with Doc&#039;s &quot;impossible to comment on&quot; comment.
Wait, do I sound like me, or Comedian? Or both? Argh!

Aside: still Rudys run deep. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, the anime-feel of &quot;Falcon&quot; felt really right to me, I hadn&#039;t remembered the character name but I knew you meant Nantalith even before you told her you did. Comedian and SystemFailure are straightforward, and I had remembered River as Rudy&#039;s alter ego. (Also, I think, it&#039;s bizarrely reflective of his actual personality. Quietly flowing. Or something :). I suspect &quot;Sparrow&quot; felt right to me because I enjoy birds so much, and often write about them. Also, I&#039;m pecky. Picky. Whatever.

You could have called me &quot;AfternoonTea&quot;. Or &quot;EarlGreyHot&quot; :&#062;. 

Nitpick: &quot;rings very true&quot; or &quot;feels very familiar&quot;, not &quot;rings very familiar&quot;. Other than that, I am forced to realise at second hand precisely how hesitantly I tend to frame my comments. I shall now spend the next fifteen years feeling acutely self-conscious about my turns of phrase.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! 

The names come from the current nicks, and from past stories. For you, I thought the &quot;feathers&quot; story had sparrows (but now I check they are actually starlings!) and well, tiffin was too obvious, and sparrow felt right...

Falcon is a character from Nantaliths &quot;soup&quot; story, and I guess it had slight anime-naming overtones which felt right.

Comedian and SystemFailure are largely based on current nicks, and also on personality/profession.

River was Rudy&#039;s own name for his alter ego in the &quot;stop&quot; story, so that was the easiest!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[p.s. am now absolutely fascinated, (a) by your facility with voice (you&#039;ve nailed everyone, there&#039;s no doubt at all who&#039;s who, you are a fearfully observant person), and (b) why &quot;Sparrow&quot;? or, for that matter, &quot;Falcon&quot;? Both obscurely work, but I&#039;d be interested to know what was going through your head.]]></description>
