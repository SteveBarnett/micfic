		<description><![CDATA[Yay!
I am very pleased to see that the bit about submitting your story very late was a filthy lie.
Huzzah! :D

I have put away my Rod of Ritual Shaming.
But I reserve the right to whip it out later!]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure that I&#039;m going to make the deadline for this story either. I will try to post it this coming weekend, though.]]></description>
