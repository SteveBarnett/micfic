		<description><![CDATA[A clever idea, and the medium (no pun intended) of a letter is a good way to deliver it. 

I had some trouble with the tone: I found it a little too stilted at times compared with the poetry of other sections. The merlot, the clammy touch, the living death, are all quite poetic and descriptive. In contrast, 

I promised our relationship would be forever 

I canâ€™t get a momentâ€™s privacy.

our friends keep organising blind dates 

all feel a bit matter-of-fact, and the tone changes from sentence to sentence as a result.

I felt there was a missed opportunity here - this is a story about falling out of love with someone, and maybe it could have been told by drawing parallels with a normal couple falling out of love. Love ends for many reasons, and I would have liked to have a sense that he fell out of love with her, and the physical complaints were a symptom of this but not the cause?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very sweet and not as creepy as one might expect.
Really lovely language. I especially enjoyed:
&#062; plum rich Merlot
and
&#062; those familiar intimacies more terrifying than exciting.

I really liked the keeping-a-secret vibes, especially the comment about the blind dates - funny and telling.

The only bit that didn&#039;t quite wangle my grenfriks was
&#062; Iâ€™m still having nightmares about your last tantrum ...
It seemed a little too cold compared to the rest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this! You captured the tone perfectly, and it is a lovely twist on a love story /  Dear John letter. It is potentially serious and tragic or hilarious, and you treat it with a very light touch passing between the two. I enjoyed the detail about situations: dinner with Merlot in front of the fire, work and friends, sex. I think the first paragraph introduces the letter beautifully with high ideas about love and fidelity. 

I didn&#039;t like the bit about moaning around the house - I would have preferred the sentence with that word left out. It felt like a little bit of a cheap shot when most of the letter rang true. Also, the young couple with young children feels a bit clumsy with the repetition of &quot;young&quot;.]]></description>
