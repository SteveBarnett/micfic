		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.

Well, the player isn&#039;t a ghost hunter, I guess, so maybe that&#039;s why - lol~]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like this and thought is was very clever. I had no problem with the &quot;so limited&quot; and &quot;crazily lucky&quot;, they sounded exactly like a kind of stock phrase - makes sense if you say this was an actual quote from your gaming, that&#039;s exactly how it felt.

The tone, the gamer language, all work perfectly. The reveal was slow for me, and I often don&#039;t read titles properly so I didn&#039;t put that together at first, but in the end it made perfect sense.

Only gripe, on second reading, was how could a &quot;Ghost Hunter&quot; misread &quot;ghost town&quot;? It bothered me a little as surely a Ghost Hunter would always expect ghosts?

All in all, brilliant, and thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool! Fun!
I like the stepped reveal of the in-the-game-world aspect.

Two little personal preference sort of niggles:
&#062; my limited, so limited, supplies
and
&#062; really, really crazily lucky,
didn&#039;t quite work for me.
&quot;so limited&quot; didn&#039;t add anything an felt somehow slightly out of tone with the rest, an the second really seemed superfluous.

I dig the final line.Very &quot;uh oh. That&#039;s a big beastie up there&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[This captures the immersed video gamer beautifully without being obvious about it at all. It reminded me a little of Order of the Stick, but was less flippant. I really enjoyed it, especially on a second read when I was clearer about it being a game. The title had a futuristic/post-apocalyptic (cyborg protagonist) vibe for me, rather than video game so I only understood in the third paragraph.

I presume in &quot;A misread is defiantly one of those little things.&quot; (2nd paragraph) you meant &quot;definitely&quot;. The word &quot;defiantly&quot; sent my mind off on a complete (not entirely unpleasant) tangent about how a misread could be defiant :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.  

I was nervous about too much detail in case people realised immediately it was for a game.  I often find that a bit tricky as I know what is going on but I don&#039;t want the reader to get right away so to be on the safe side I go heavy on vague.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was fun! I didn&#039;t pick up the computer-game aspect until halfway through, which will teach me to read too fast and not look properly at the title (the title is clever!). The matter-of-fact tone is interesting, it makes you look harder at the story as you try to work out why the speaker isn&#039;t registering fear or dread, which allows the computer-game thing to sneak up on you. I enjoyed this, thank you.

You could, perhaps, have had some fun with the reality/game interplay by including some descriptive details of the actual town, this felt a little flat and abstract?]]></description>

I didn&#039;t want to do a &#039;classic&#039; ghost story but it kept coming to mind - lol~  I&#039;m pleased with how it came out though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cute idea, I like the slow introduction to it - &#039;death - repeatedly&#039; :)
Also like the general cross over ideas between game and reality; fear amnd challenge.

Worked kinda well for me.]]></description>
