		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I&#039;m glad it worked in the end.

I do need to work on a way to distinguish the paragraphs from each other, but have not come up with a good solution...

&quot;Bleeding&quot; probably doesn&#039;t work as it&#039;s too british in an american-feel story?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what came over me with the itchy pants, they were just there. I started that paragraph four times and with the itchy pants, it just flowed. 

I am obviously incapable of non-itchy pants here, confusion be damned! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I did not have the whole story, of course, but the impression of that had to be there, to make it feel like a fragment of something bigger. I did just focus on minimal flashes, like an action movie, and I think that worked in letting the reader fill in the story.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, glad you liked it and it made sense!

South African name: not sure what you mean? 

The narration - I see your point, it&#039;s something I would not have spotted myself as I&#039;m too close to the story, but it&#039;s true - I&#039;ll think about how I can express it differently!

And thanks for the dialogue commas, always get that one wrong.

		<description><![CDATA[As is becoming traditional for me reading your stories, I didn&#039;t get this at all on the first read. Eventually I got it and I liked it a lot.
The little snatches of time from the four different bits really works as a sketch of who what where how.
You&#039;ve built up a big world in a tiny space, especially the dangerous feeling of the looming disaster without saying much about it.

Really, really, liked the interrupted endings of each paragraph.
Creates great tension and speed.
Liked the evil supper-villain the best. Shame they didn&#039;t get a chance to monologue.I&#039;m sure their plan was sheer elegance in its simplicity!

About the only thing that didn&#039;t work for me was
&#062; bleeding inversion field
Although I can&#039;t quite pinpoint why.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was great and a lot of fun. You completely got the cut scenes in a disaster movie climax. It was exciting in the same way :-) I agree with Rudy about the  &quot;- I look up &quot; bit, but not about the villain bit. Villains always monologue in these kinds of movies :-) 

One small niggle is the itchy pants. It took me off on a weird tangent about something being wrong with the pants and the itchiness being significant. I would have preferred less confusing musings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool idea and I like the &#039;moment-bites&#039; of each paragraph. 

Think the minimal descriptions of exactly what the physical observable are is cute - we know the sky is ? and the air feels thin; electrical storm or tornado like - just enough to tease the imagination.

Similairly the motives and roles of the involved characters (paragraphs 3 + 4) say just too little to answer any real question about the situation - really like this openess and it gives the impression you had a whole story-line behind these brief excerpts. 

I like the multiple voices but like Dox it took me at least a second reading to figure it out. Perhaps starting each paragraph out with a location name might help I might have been tempted by:
[cnr 6th and 12th]: These pants are itching. Of course, these are the itchy...]]></description>
