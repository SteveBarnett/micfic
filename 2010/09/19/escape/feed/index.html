		<description><![CDATA[Very scary, me like!

The can&#039;t-get-away dream logic comes across really well and strong fear.
I didn&#039;t have too much trouble with the lack of details on the who / what / where. For me, it worked as part of the dream world. You know you have to run, evne if you don&#039;t quite know why!

I raised an eyebrow at the double use of violation, but it was only a little raise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liked this. I think that bits of it captures very nicely what it&#039;s like to have a dream like this: never being able to get away from the chaser-person, who always appears behind you. Sometimes forgetting what it was that you were doing just moments before.

I also enjoyed the writing style: simple and descriptive. 

Also, this piece made me think of Scar :)

I did feel a bit cheated at the end when this all turned out to be a dream, but a part of that is a hold up from when I was a kid and teachers kept telling me not to have everything be a dream. I do think, in retrospect, that the story hangs together well with the dreaminess of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah! And then she woke up. :)

The dreamlike logic, the intense irrational fear, is very real, and after the first reading - once you know it is a dream - it is a fitting voice. 

I wished there was a little more setting in the first paragraph, as I felt the sentences all gave me emotion but too little context. Once I knew it was a dream this was understandable, but I still wonder if it would have been possible to make the dream slightly more real (where am I running through, who is chasing me, what is it like?) without losing the dream. It would have made my first read through more tangible. 

Now off to bed for some proper nightmares!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent idea. I think the twist at the end works really well and speaks nicely of the ambiguity of inner voices. 

I think the style and flow of the first paragraphs gives the dreamy impression well. The imagery is great (like lungs + poker thing) and conveys the spirit of nightmares.]]></description>
