		<description><![CDATA[I am in two minds about this one - on the one hand, it echoes very strange, dreamlike, meta-reality stuff, and it does it very well, twisting and changing old stories to remove their meaning and purpose. it made me think of the philosophical musings in &quot;Our Tragic Universe&quot; by Scarlett Thomas - thoughts about the &quot;storyless story&quot; and how narrative tends to force meaning on a story, but that meaning is not really there until the narrative invents it. This direction is very interesting, even though telling stories that are storyless is difficult, as the narrative keeps wanting to creep back in and create order. 

The other hand was i think down to the first paragraph, which framed it for me in a way which didn&#039;t quite work. Go, vagueness! 

On the whole, this is worth experimenting with more as the results are interesting!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dig stories in stories (in stories), and this worked well for me.
First read felt a bit full / overloaded, but return reads felt great.

I really liked the return of Mr Packham, especially with the new twist / spin, and the bringing in of River worked well.

Another hand in the air for &quot;fist paragraph good but not great.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oooh, upside-down Arabian Nights! I loved this - very layered, rather subversive about storytelling expectations, and a witty and amusing inversion of reality and the story. Loved the fictionalising of the personal, and the intrusion of a different version of an earlier micfic - a lot of meaningful echoes there. I&#039;d say this was a resonant piece, but stv will laugh at me :&#062;. It&#039;s also cleverly written, in that the classic storytelling/fiction world becomes the critical/intellectual world even as the real world becomes fictional. 

I also felt that the first paragraph was a little clumsy compared to the rest, and possibly laid out the background slightly mechanically - it seemed to me to require a slightly different tone or approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeh, I thought long about that first paragraph. It takes up a good chunk of the word count :-/ I think it (or something similar) needs to be there, though, for a bit of context.

Personally, I don&#039;t see it as Scheherazade committing suicide, but rather wanting to try something new. But I did try leaving it rather open — I hope it wasn&#039;t too open.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this and found it clever. I loved its layeredness and connections to reality, previous stories and classic stories. I took the end to be a retelling of the Scheherezade story: either it is the  1001st night, or this is a parallel universe where she continues to entice him but through exciting intellectual discussion :-). 

I have a small grammatical issue. In the second sentence &quot;...had at first been exhilarating — now the tedium of it,...&quot;, the hyphen feels wrong to me here. I would prefer a semi-colon or full stop maybe.]]></description>
