		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this. As has been said, the dialogue is spot-on. It sounds completely right and is very, very funny. And I also love the way the title connects with the piece.

I didn&#039;t see it as being particularly religious but saw it on a re-read, and love the random mercury/tequila bits. I also love the blood from the red spanner. Maybe if the spanner was working on something other than a tap it wouldn&#039;t be so religious. For me it is the water into wine that makes the connection to Jesus. If the wine came from nowhere that might change things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You know, maybe the problem with the tequila/mercury/blood/Jesus thing is not that they&#039;re too random, it&#039;s that they&#039;re not random &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; - because there&#039;s a Jesus/blood connection, one starts looking for other connections. I loved the randomness of the tequila/mercury, maybe the blood needs to be maple syrup or paint or artificial food colouring #12 or something?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two people, α and β, are talking about α&#039;s phd work. α had said that their work was initially about time travel, but the results are not what they&#039;re expecting if it were time travel. Indeed, α now thinks that it is something to do with trans-dimensional shifting. It ends with some (maybe Angelic) voice, presumably from our phd student&#039;s other dimension, telling them to prepare their souls.

I liked this. As others have said, the dialogue is good and funny :)

Unlike A and Docinatrix, I also enjoyed the randomness of the tequila / mercury, which goes well with the last sentence (where α ignores the voices) — it reminds me of students getting their first results, when the results are interesting and very unexpected. This goes for the post-hoc change of the theory from time-machine to trans-dimensional shifting as well. 

&#062; What’s going on?!
?! has always irked me. It reminds me of speech bubbles in comics, and informal IRC / email / LOLcat / 4chan writing. Not that that&#039;s necessarily a bad thing. Some writers (*cough* Neal Stephenson *cough*) use it a lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; On a side note: spanner seems to produce ‘fuck’ a lot – three stories.

And although it didn&#039;t happen in the story, mine was sort of about fucking.
Fuck!

No-one needs this blog to be SFW, right? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome!
You have a real talent for dialogue, yo. Word. Words, even.

The tone was perfect and really evoked (!) that showing-someone-your-experiment and getting-them-to-go-through-the-same-steps-so-that-they-believe-it.
&#062; Will you just look at the spanner?
and
&#062; Can I just note this doesn’t seem very scientific?
really brought this home for me.
Strong personalities on the two peeps.

On the first read through, I didn&#039;t get that the caps were the mice. Reading it again I can&#039;t see how I missed it - it&#039;s obvious. I am thick.

I really like the &quot;title as story ending&quot; thingy also. Tricksy.

I concur wrt the comments above about choosing random or religion and sticking with it. It doesn&#039;t break the story, but it would improve it to keep it on one track.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, glad you liked.

As I said to the doc, the question is whether the central idea is religious stuff, or the sheer randomness. I need to make it more of the one or the other, I think.

The time machine thing is part of the general non-sensicness (is that even a word) of the story. It jumps, it meanders. does it work? Not entirely sure! It was fun to write though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you muchly. It is very silly, and was written more or less unplanned (worked so well last time), and it meanders more or less randomly, which is what I intended.

I know what you mean about the tequila and mercury line. I debated it back on forth - on the one hand, something like wine and molten lava would fit much better with the blood. On the other hand, I thought I wanted it to be really random, rather than apocalyptic.... I will ponder this some more, it will be tighter if I focus on one thing only.]]></description>
