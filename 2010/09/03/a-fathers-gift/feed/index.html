		<description><![CDATA[I really love this. Its one of my favourites of yours. It begins beautifully - really like the alliteration.

I only found it slightly sad. For me it was mostly magical (like &#039;the indian in the cupboard&#039; kind of magic one finds in everyday life and things). I loved the descriptions of the two families - they were so rich and evocative.

The last paragraph is the bit I like least, but it finished the piece off well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really lovely.
I can&#039;t believe all those names are real! The world is such a weird place. Or maybe it&#039;s just hardware stores...
Great idea - the stories of the spanners are great and I loved the cavernous, levelled, layered, feel of the box. A world in a box.

&#062; I’d sooner be a poet than player
This didn&#039;t quite work for me, but I&#039;m hard pressed to say why.

&#062; inky depths
Tiny tweak potential? Inky is classic for darkness, but something more relevant could&#039;ve been nicer? Oily depths?

The pathos / humour combo is very finely balanced and skilfully employed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[agree with other commenters - a lovely fantasy about the inner lives of the spanner family (and those are the real names of spanners! I didn&#039;t know! no wonder the main character wanted to tell their stories!), wrapped in a poignant father-son relationship.

It would have been awesome if there was some way of ending the circle - living out his relatioship with his father, or his ideal relationship, through Torx and his dad, reconciling the two through the medium of modern spanners, something like that (!) - tightening the relatiohship between the two worlds, as it were. But that is not a niggle, only a suggestion for further consideration...

The choice of &quot;player&quot; bothers me a little in the first paragraph - I don&#039;t quite see how his dad wants him to be a player. I suspect you mean in the sense of actor rather than writer, but in mind mind it talks to &quot;player&quot; - man with many girls, etc, which feels wrong.

I like the descriptions very much.Inky depths and all the spanner&#039;s personalities. Great stuff.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is about a son who feels that he&#039;s somehow failed his father in not being interested in the same things his father is interested in, in the same ways that his father&#039;s interested in them in. A case in point: the gift of spanners, which the son uses as characters in his fantasy life and not — presumably — as the hard working tools they are.

I enjoyed this. I liked the play between the son&#039;s happiness at having these &quot;toys&quot; to play with, but the sadness that he&#039;s &quot;doing it wrong&quot; for his dad. 

&#062; built for dirty, tough jobs[,] he always despised his son’s delicate
&#062; nature
It felt as though an extra comma was needed.

&#062; Rigger-Jigger
Woah, that&#039;s a great name.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liked this a lot - a poignant, rather endearing piece of writing, the fantasy elements very nicely balanced against the reality of the father/son relationship. It teeters on that very fine line where it could be funny, but really isn&#039;t because there&#039;s too much pathos there. And the heroic themes of the stories very delicately explore and represent the real-world difficulties of the speaker. Another of those deceptively slight pieces that&#039;s actually doing a lot. Thank you, enjoyed!]]></description>
