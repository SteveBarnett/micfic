		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I know you what you meant - I think we classify that as a typo. It&#039;s an accidental error as opposed to a conscious change of wording / meaning / fishing / fucking (!).

Or you could just be more careful when push comes to shove.
I made a funny.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, but what I meant was &quot;oops, I know I changed push to shove in that final version, bugger, I&#039;ve uploaded the version without my final few tweaks&quot; - which I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve done twice now. I write these things between work and campus, sending them backwards and forwards, and every now and then I degenerate into a complete file-twit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With this Theme the categories will always be listed in Alphanumberical order.
We can fudge date listing by changing the format from
Light – 31/05/2010 to 13/06/2010
to
2010/05/31 tp 2010/06/13 - Light.
I shall do this.]]></description>

&quot;Oops, I meant to put shove and not shov&quot; is okay.
&quot;Oops, I meant to put shove and not push&quot; is not. It&#039;s part of the challenge to get it how you want it in the time-frame. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a sort of personal rule thingy that I&#039;m allowed to catch typos and (twice now) the occasional word tweak that got lost in the version-switches between home and campus (as in, bugger, I know I changed that!) - but only if I catch them in the first five minutes after I put the story up. Does this sound overly self-indulgent?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since we&#039;ve all suggested one Theme now, I think we&#039;ll call that Volume I (and I&#039;ve re-categorised accordingly) and start cycling the Theme suggesters again.
That means me for the next one - eep! It will appear later today.]]></description>
