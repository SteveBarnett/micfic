		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this and found it very clever. It conveyed the stream-of-consciousness way that thoughts work very well. I liked the flow of ideas from in a pickle to pickles in a jar to spanners to the embedded story and back out again. Unlike the others I really liked the last line. It fitted very well with the vibe of the rest of the piece and connected nicely to our discussions about word limit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is one of my favourites.
I really liked the discussion of writer&#039;s block and felt much the same when trying to write for my own theme some weeks ago. A difficult interesting think to talk about and the revolutions around the idiom are cute.

In the second sentence I assume you meant &#039;phrase&#039; not &#039;phase&#039; and this caused me some confusion.

&#039;Take a firm grip...&#039; - great sentence.

I was less keen on the italics paragraph but it worked okay for me. The last line seems a little out of context - somehow the breaking down between writing micfic and talking about micfic bugged me here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is an original approach, and very self-conscious about the act of writing; you have to mentally dig at what&#039;s going on here, which make it dense and interesting. I was a bit confused by the initial pickle/spanner relationship, which didn&#039;t quite seem to follow (maybe you use a spanner to open a pickle jar that&#039;s closed too tightly?), but I liked the morphing of the image into taking &quot;a firm grip on your imagination&quot; and twisting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Groovy!
Nice descriptions of pickles and their life - &quot;Drowned for months in brine&quot; - eep!
Also: I dig stories in stories.

The last line didn&#039;t quite work for me.
It was little of out style with the rest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a cool way to write your way out of a writer&#039;s block. Nice mix of themes and the obsession over an idiom has a very familiar feel - the way something you say all the time suddenly jumps into focus and you realise what you&#039;ve been saying and ask what the hell does it mean?

For some reason, the use of profanity fucking works here. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like it. A story in a story. I could benefit from expansion even. 

I also like the way you likened a migraine to a machine that&#039;s malfunctioning. You would know, huh?]]></description>
