		<description><![CDATA[I prefer the term prostidroid.
Um...

Re  play on the title: thanks!
I think it was actually on a spedition that we were talking about SITW as the most obvious jump form Spanner as a Theme, and I couldn&#039;t help thinking it sounded like a cocktail. Robo-hookers followed naturally from there...!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
I was trying to make the whole robo thing-o not entirely in-yer-face, so thatâ€™s cool.
I was quite happy with the general scummy dive feeling.

Re terseness: ta! Maybe Iâ€™m worrying about it too much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero, a prostitute, sits down at a bar and orders a drink. We&#039;re treated to a view of life for sapient robots, and the story ends with Our Hero finding a customer and walking him off to a booth to perform their &quot;transaction&quot;. 

Ha! I love the play on the title. It wasn&#039;t what I was expecting when I began reading this. I enjoyed the setting: it was fun and interesting, left me wondering what else would be happening. And I wanted to know more about the prostitute and the customer. 

&#062; Finally I manage to catch the bar-droidâ€™s eye-stalk.
While I completely understood this the first time that I read it, it did leave me with a picture in my mind of a very literal understanding of that sentence :P 

I was also thinking about capitalisation: one would usually capitalise the title (or the name of a drink) like this: &quot;Spanner in the Works.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, man!
I suppose I&#039;ve spent enough time in various dives to get a good feel for them :).

I wasn&#039;t entirely happy with the general shortness / terseness of the main character, like &quot;He nods. I let go. He slides off.&quot; But maybe it kind of fits with the personality.

Shall see what I can do re cocktail.
:D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely and light. 
&#039;Spanner in the works&#039; - great drink name - suggest you invent it for meat-space meet-up.
Really like how the bar has a sense of fringeness - the human who doesn&#039;t fit in with others is accepted here - all the positive understanding of a real dive.
Entire thing made me want to sit the corner of the greasy bar and robot-watch.

Really like the word &#039;transaction&#039; and the ambiguity of what the implied robot sex really is.

No real criticism -  perfect in its genre.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
A robo ho, yo.

I may write a follow up story about robot sex.
Not really.
Probably.

I felt this was a bit rushed.
Sentences a bit too short and snappy.
Ho hum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool! I love the setting, reminded me of the &quot;hive of scum and villany&quot; on Tattooine at first, but I did catch on to it being a robot bar about half way through and that worked for me. Interesting main character - worn out robot prostitute (for robots) is actually quite a fresh concept!

I liked the tone and vibe, and the machine man comes across as a very interesting character that I would like to get to know better.

Would make a good intro to a longer story about the modded man.

Thank you! Really enjoyed it.]]></description>
