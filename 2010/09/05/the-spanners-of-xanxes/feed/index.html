		<description><![CDATA[Great visual ideas. Love the tease-descriptions of the other life forms - very intriguing.

I enjoyed the contrast between the (rather nasty sounding) brown toadstools and the spectacular orange sky of spanners spanning.

Unlike the others I don&#039;t feel a lack of intent/focus/point here - the simple, rich description of something unusual was enough to engage me for this length - a celebration of strangeness told with lightness and some humour.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a descriptive piece about Spanners, an organism which uses long strands to span the planet in search of a mate.

Interesting piece. The world-spanning creatures are lovely, as are hints of other odd creatures: the &quot;bats&quot; and the &quot;bear&quot;. Also, &quot;diaphanous&quot; is a great word :)

Like others, I had problems with how the piece is very much only a description of the spanners. It did get me thinking for ages about writing and plot and story, though, which was cool. I&#039;m not going to infodump my thoughts here, other than to say that for me, what this piece lacks is a &quot;meaning&quot; to what is being described. I don&#039;t know what this means (what its implication is) to Susan, to the spanners themselves, or to the narrator. 

Thank you for the piece :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. I agree about the voice. I wasn&#039;t very happy with it and ran out of time, but the creature descriptions were the important thing and I&#039;m glad they worked. I must confess that I was thinking of the piece more as an extract than stand-alone when I was writing it, so its no surprise that it came out as more background.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments. I like Swarm-Bear too. 

Xanxes = zanksees :-)

See parfles response for spanner. Never thought of a meaning possibly coming from tendrils looking like spanners. Cool.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks :-) I must admit that I thought of this meaning of span first, odd though that is. I think it might have something to do with it sounding a bit like Scanners, which is a sci-fi movie I know well and about people who are named for their function.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the praise and the crit :-) The world building stuff and strange creatures were the bits I like most about this. I&#039;m not very happy with the style - formatting it more like a report would certainly improve that. 

I meant Spanners because of the tendrils spanning the sky but can see how it would be confusing. I don&#039;t think I emphasised it very well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also vaguely toyed with the idea of &quot;spanners&quot; as &quot;things that span&quot;, but couldn&#039;t come up with anything meaningful - I like the way you&#039;ve played with the idea, and the fun and inventive alien species which have resulted. This didn&#039;t work for me, though, on the level of voice - I&#039;m with Parfles in thinking that the format is a bit dry and straightforward, and that this really needs some other kind of &quot;in&quot; to the mere fact of the spanners&#039; existence. You needed, I think, to jump off from the idea of the spanners into some actual kind of plot or urgency - this is more background than story. I&#039;d love to see what you did with it in a longer format, with the basic idea as a starting point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice!
I like the Spanners themselves a lot - lovely description of them - and the other aminals in the menagerie.
I&#039;m also a little confused, though.

The last paragraph seems to imply that the criss-cross orange sky inspired the name, whereas for me it was more obvious from &quot;...tendril would curve down towards the source of the scent...&quot; that kinda looks like a bent spanner. Thing. Stuff.

I like the name Swarm-Bear. Can I have one?
Last thought: pronunciation guide for Xanxes?
