		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this, but found it very quite hard to read. It was very dense and filled with poetry. I particularly love the following bits:
&quot;The limitations of my grandfather’s spanner were defined by the sinew of his arms&quot;
&quot;Like my grandfather, I bend my body to the needs of this machine. He craned headfirst into engine blocks; I employ my tools halfway up ladders into loci of imponderable force.&quot; (imponderable works for me in capturing the immensity of the force)
&quot;Failure brought him sullenly in from the yard to be revived with supper, the squatting diesel beast to be tamed another day.&quot;
And the last sentence, which is a beautiful culmination of the piece.

I think I would have preferred the context of the narrator to be less dramatic and life threatening, so that it was more similar to the grandfather&#039;s situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kewl!
I really enjoyed this.
It is very dense and Mieville-esque, but is still very groovy.
It does feel a little cramped.

Top word treats for me:
&#062; fanciful nubs
(tee hee) and
&#062; loci of imponderable force.
Although, like Rudy, I raised an eyebrow at imponderable for our engineer.

I found
&#062; four thousand varied combinations mate my wrench with every iteration of the myriad impenetrable locks stapling a standard drive to itself.
and
&#062; His hampered rotations created brute couplings to assist the combustions of motion.
extra thick and heavy, but not incomprehensibly so. Just stickier to get through.

&#062;  If I drop mine, as I do now, from sweating hands urgent with need, it rebounds from a bulkhead to vanish, in a spray of sparks, into the heat-death of the drive.
felt a bit long and busy.

Whinge, whinge, whinge, but I thought it was great!

		<description><![CDATA[Hello! this is the middle bear, not too long, not too short, just right! (This in response to word worries).

I think the language density is very Mieville (still reading Kraken. Progress improved since I cast Charlie Cox as Billy http://a8.vietbao.vn/images/vn2/van-hoa/20725489_images1378267_3_Charlie_Cox.jpg excuse the vietnamese link now where was I?)

Right, Mieville, dense and deep and equal-opportunities empowering all polysyllabic words in the dictionary. That&#039;s you here. (Aside - we should generate some statistics per writer. Like average word length. yes.)

This comment is a wayword puppy. I like your story. I like the way it develops from innocuous comparison of olde- and newy-time spanners to gently having plot, tm, with developments and all. Very cool.

Favourite bit - the last sentence. I seem to be fond of profanity this fortnight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad the pacing worked for you, that paragraph also felt essential to me, which was why it was so difficult to cut this down. &quot;Created brute couplings to assist the combustions of motion&quot; is the one phrase I really had to fight, and it&#039;s about a third the length it should be, so I have to agree it doesn&#039;t quite work. It will in the longer version. She says, in tones of low menace.

Interestingly, I didn&#039;t see the grandfather as a mechanic, my mental image was my own grandfather, retired and fiddling with cars for fun - hence yard and grass et al. 

but I&#039;m happy you enjoyed this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See Rudy&#039;s comment re the need for the third paragraph, not just for pacing, but for developing the parallel ;&#062;. I really enjoy how everyone sees something different in these comments - I have no control over how people read, it&#039;s endlessly fascinating. That last sentence is very dense, but it&#039;s saying what I want it to say, so I fear I may simply be incorrigible on the density front. Sigh. (The previous one, &quot;brute couplings&quot; etc, is horribly compressed and really doesn&#039;t work. Sigh). But I&#039;m glad you feel this works as &quot;engineerese&quot; - it was really intended to work as dense Mieville-style convolution, but if it does double duty, yay!

and thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Space Engineer is attempting to repair life support on a ship. While doing so, they think back on their grandfather — a mechanic — and the similarities and differences between their shared occupation. Then, in a moment when it would have been better not to, Our Space Engineer drops their spanner and loses it.

I didn&#039;t particular feel that this suffered from trying to cut it down. I enjoyed how the language is very descriptive and sometimes seems to play double duty, like with &quot;I bend my body to the needs of this machine&quot;.

I also enjoy how the fourth paragraph is the where we first see any &quot;action&quot;. For me, the description of the previous paragraphs help the three sentences of action to feel more powerful than they would without them. So I&#039;m not sure if losing the third paragraph would be a good thing. Maybe it would destroy the timing of the story?

Having the engineer describe a bit of the engine as being imponderable felt wrong to me — isn&#039;t their job to understand the forces it employs? You said you were worried about incomprehensibility: the only place I had to ponder a bit was at &quot;created brute couplings to assist the combustions of motion.&quot; Everything else was great!

Very cool writing in this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really liked this and I love descriptions of the rarely mentioned relationships between people and their tools.
I enjoyed the technical heavy vocabulary (who would have thought &#039;specificity&#039; would ever fit into a micfic) - it communicated the engineering mindset well.

For the first and last paragraphs are the best - clean tight and lovely.

Perhaps, as you suggest, the word limit pressured you - but I feel the third paragraph could have been skipped without much reducing the content that was important to me. And the last sentence of that paragraph is the only one that I stumbled on due to it&#039;s complexity (density?).

I loved &#039;defined by the sinew of his arms&#039; and &#039;nut-analogue&#039;.

Also the ending was great - some things stay the same!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is 295 words, and absolutely resists being any smaller. I also darkly suspect that I&#039;ve edited it into incomprehensibility: the language in this for some reason wanted to be particularly dense. Generally the 250-word limit is very good for me, but I think the 350-word version of this is a better piece of writing.]]></description>
