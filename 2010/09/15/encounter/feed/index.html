		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!

Geckos from outer space!
Ahem.

I think I may be starting to get the hang of this dialogue thing.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Rude!

Re tail: the picture I had in my head was that she&#039;s very diferrent. The tail isn&#039;t the only thing that makes her look a bit odd!

With you on the ha ha. That bit felt a bit empty when writing it, but looking at it again, it doesn&#039;t need the ha. Ha!

I&#039;m not too worried about the coffee. It&#039;s in the scene for me as a typical bus stop thing, and I&#039;m not sure how to work in &quot;She was carrying a coffee&quot; in.

Re Saying: typo! Fixed. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Parfles.
Glad you like the dialogue. I often find myself thinking WWPD when writing speaky bits. :)

&#062; Teasing lady of mystery, the shy-and-sweet main character.
I guess I&#039;m writing what I know! ;)]]></description>

Rethinking the descriptive bits, I am.

Glad you liked the skip.
The vibe of the departure somehow felt important.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this. It is a beautiful magical-realism kind of story, full of lovely ideas like the perception field and people it doesn&#039;t affect. I love the characterisation of both the main character and the girl. 

I was slightly distracted by the fact that she was holding a cup of coffee and then waved her hands around with a flourish not long afterwards. It felt a bit like a continuity glitch, which shows you how visually I was reading your piece :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought this was so cute.

Though, when she skips off, which I like, her tail is wrapping and unwrapping around the lamppost.  It sounds a bit like her tail has stayed behind while she skipped off - sort of like a gecko that looses its tail, it keeps twisting around.

I also liked the dialogue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero is sitting at a bus stop when a strange woman sits down beside him and begins to quiz him over whether he can see and understand her. She is protected by a &quot;perception field&quot;, through which he can naturally see. She is in some way not human, and has a tail.

I thought that the dialogue was fun and amusing; I also enjoyed the holdback about her tail. Unlike Docinatrix, I like to think that he only notices the tail at the end, when she moves off.

I have some nitpicks:

&#062; Ha ha.
A very small nitpick: I&#039;m not a fan of onomatopoeic laughing. I never find it natural. Also, although it&#039;s sometimes clear from context, I usually need to think about if the person is merely saying, &quot;Ha ha,&quot; or actually laughing. 

&#062; steam from her coffee misting my glasses.
I felt as though the coffee magically appeared. This is the first time that it&#039;s mentioned, and (for me) it&#039;s mentioned in a way that feels as though I should have known about it. 

&#062; I saying, nodding my head
&quot;saying&quot; should be &quot;say&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Docinatrix. I love this - the language is great, and the descriptive bits work. I would like to particularly mention the dialogue - I&#039;m a dialogue fundi, and this _works_, this is _real_, it is how people talk. The personalities - the teasing lady of mystery, the shy-and-sweet main character - come across beautifully, and I feel your writing is tight and awesome here.

I really enjoyed the slow reveal and the growing sense of mystery. I look forward to his further adventures - there is more that he will learn of that other world in time, I&#039;m sure...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I fear I disagree. I don&#039;t think those extra descriptive phrases are unnecessary, I think they work very well to establish the character of the speaker - hesitant, unsure of himself, a bit fussy. You&#039;re seeing the encounter through his eyes, and his perspective is slightly pedantic. He notices details - his paperback, the steam from her coffee, the clothes of the other people present - so his observation of her magician&#039;s hand-wave and his own tendencies fit right in. This makes it thematically very tight, because the whole point of the encounter is the fact that he does see things other people don&#039;t. It also sets up the last sentence beautifully - the speaker is so fussy with all the other details, the fact that he&#039;s held the tail in reserve until the end is a particularly effective jolt. 

I&#039;ve commented all backwards, like. I really liked this: a tight, effective piece of writing, well-observed and beautifully paced. And amusing. I like the way she &quot;skips&quot; off, she has a slightly sinister insouciance which comes across very well.]]></description>
