		<description><![CDATA[Nice!
Poetic and punchy.

I also have a slight feeling of it not quite fitting together well, but I did enjoy the bits that make it up.
I kind of liked the abrupt end: it fits with the staccato (good word, cbraz!) feeling of the piece. I might have pushed the last sentence into its own paragraph though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very beautiful, and very much poetry, really, with the rhythmic feel of it. Very much a start - stop rhythm, which fits in well with the theme!

I agree with cbraz and elementalsystems about some of the bits not fitting as well as others, but there is a lot of very strong stuff here. I like the questioning, prodding, pontificating voice of it - like an old teacher, prod, prod, prodding you about your recorder. 

I think most of the kinks would be sorted out with some minor editing to make odd ends fit in better, and it&#039;s a strong piece that would take that sort of revision well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are many things I would fix with this bit o&#039; text were I to do it again.  To be honest, I don&#039;t like the end.  I think it&#039;s too abrupt.  

I&#039;m glad some of it appeals though :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This has a staccato flow of consciousness kind of feeling, which I like. It is edgy, jittery. I also really like some of the language, e.g., &quot;the one, two tattoo of your heart&quot; and &quot;and when you take breath there is silence&quot; and &quot;the moment of no breath as you see&quot;.

But it doesn&#039;t quite come together for me. For example, in the bit, 
&quot;It is in the silence before the storm that cascades through your memories that lies… You know that tune… Do you remember?&quot;

it begins strong but loses itself a bit for me towards the end.]]></description>

I agree with the disjointed feeling, it could have been better but this piece was really rushed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had to read this out loud to appreciate it - really like the rhythm and sound of it. 

I like the music section for this quality and I think it serves well as introduction to the ideas. 

But for me the love paragraph is the highlight - beautiful and elegant with strong Toaist vibes. I wish I had written that paragraph. 

So I liked the bits very much but feel that it doesn&#039;t fit together particularly well; I found it disjointed - the umbrella idea of &#039;it&#039;s all in the stops&#039; is perhaps a bit broad is a bit broad for the length perhaps.]]></description>
