		<description><![CDATA[Damn, I&#039;m sorry, Nantalith, I keep on not commenting on your stories - you put them up very early, usually, and I forget to come back to them when I&#039;m in commenting mode. I liked the memories/feathers analogy in this, it works very well - both light, insubstantial things which lend themselves naturally to images of flight. I also liked the blurring of boundaries between reality and metaphor in this. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like the surreal metaphor here - the imagery of the falling feather and the associations with half-remembered dreams and fleeting thoughts works really well.
Also like the repetition of hands in catching feathers and again in reaching into his own heart - worked well for me; with the exceptions of the phrase  &#039;wilted hands&#039; which seriously confounded my visualisation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero is surrounded by a collection of feathers, each holding a memory. He doesn&#039;t appear to remember his own memories, and is performing a vain attempt at gathering these other memories. Ultimately, he realises that he still has his own memories; they&#039;re buried within himself — he was only trying to hide from himself. 

I enjoyed the sense of frantic desperation in the middle of the story as he tries to gather all the feathers, even though he knows that those memories will fade as soon as he lets go of them. It shows how strong his need to hide from himself is.]]></description>
