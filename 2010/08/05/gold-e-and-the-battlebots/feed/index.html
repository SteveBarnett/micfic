		<description><![CDATA[Tee hee!
Very funny, great jargon-y type bits - I really enjoyed the techy vibes.

I concur with Teh Parfles re framing text - it felt a bit weak and not quite as convincing as the very smoothly written bot talk.

Overall a great story, though - it made me smile.


p.s. Captain Higgins! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks all - glad you liked it - giggles are always acceptable.

Regarding the framing text:
Originally I had a more serious techno-babble going on in the framing as well but I changed it because:
a) I couldn&#039;t get the length short enough that way - technobabbly doesn;t communicate so well.
b) I thought it needed to be lighter to be amusing.

When I published it (and still now) I felt quite conflicted about the frame text. Will have to think carefully about a rewrite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a retelling of the Goldilocks story, where all of the characters have been transformed into science fiction style equivalents. 

I thought this was clever and very amusing. I loved the line, &quot;Found a bit of a funny&quot; :) The frame is very light hearted, especially with lines like, &quot;Yours in exploration.&quot; Which reminds me: Captain H made me think of this:
http://theoatmeal.com/comics/captain_higgins :)

I enjoyed the frame text: it may not be snappy, but it is sweet and endearing. 

It was fun seeing the Goldilocks characters come out, and the voice for both the frame and story proper was well sustained. I enjoyed this!

Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this. I found it to be a very clever interpretation of the goldilocks story and I thought it worked beautifully. The language worked perfectly for me as machine speak. I loved the way you created personality in the old bots without making them sound too human, like &quot;diminutive mechanical&quot; and &quot;intrusively analysed&quot;.
Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with Docinatrix - this is lovely and perfectly executed, and very very funny. I got what was going on around &quot;too hot for conversion&quot; (slooooow, I am!) and rocked from there. I liked the bits of personality shining through in the old &#039;bots.

i definitely needed a reread to get all the references properly, but that is a good thing and fun.

My preference would have been for less framing text which is not as snappy as the dialogue - but that is minor and not necessarily right :)

Thank you, that was fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right, so you&#039;re now guilty of causing me to sit in my office this morning with a helpless fit of the giggles. I loved this - cute, snappy, witty, the technobabble nicely done and very convincing. Baby Bear is particularly entertaining :&#062;. Also, for some reason the &quot;Analysis initiated&quot; series cracked me up.
