		<description><![CDATA[What the hey, man?
This isn&#039;t MicPoe!
But seriously - lovely.

Great tone and rhythm and gentle language.
I want to call it pretty, but I&#039;m worried that sounds trite.
Great work - I love eet!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great idea and lovely rhythms, I really love the lists of characters, things, consequences and so on. The repetition works really well in this form. Good fun to read out loud with vigour.
Also like that it is about Stories in general and their role in our lives.

I find (and like) a lot of ambiguity about who exactly the &#039;motley crew&#039; are in the last verse: the grown up children; the role-model fantasy hero&#039;s within; ideas and dreams; childhood fantasies.

I think the punctuation in poetry is not open to criticism so long as it doesn&#039;t conflict with the meter of the words (which for me it doesn&#039;t).


Poetry is easy to crit and hard to write but:
In terms of this rhythm I would remove the unicorn/born rhyme in &#039;The dragon’s egg, a unicorn, the place where forest nymphs are born&#039; as it throws me when reading it aloud (non of the verses rhyme in this spot). Similarly the last two lines miss the rhyme that ass the other verses have something like:

Ready to leap into your dreams when you start to yawn
Where their wisdom, wit and wiles will make the hours fly ‘till dawn. 
OR 
Ready to leap into your dreams where the adventure still goes on
Watch their wisdom, wit and wiles &#039;til the night is gone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool poem! I don&#039;t know much about poetry, so I can&#039;t tell you how well it works in general, but I enjoyed it. It&#039;s about telling bedtime fantasy stories, and following in the traditions of those tales.

The only thing that I wondered about in the poem was the punctuation at the end of the sentences. Seemed as tough some might be missing, but then if I ever do read a poem I wonder about the punctuation :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! Glad you liked it - I don&#039;t do poetry and was shivering me timbers, etc, as I posted.

The more I read it the more I find little upsets I&#039;d like to fix, but there are bits that flow nicely...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this and thought it was lovely. It reminded me or docinatrix&#039;s piece, while being completely different, because of the wealth of references to stories and their multiple connotations. It was so rich, I wanted to dive in and read it again and again. I am very impressed with the poetry - it works and scans and everything :-) Thanks.]]></description>
