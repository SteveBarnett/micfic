		<description><![CDATA[Mmm... cookie dough.
Alas, I have to concur re unbaked.

&quot;I wasn’t entirely clear on what was happening&quot; I know the feeling!

Various excuses (mostly canine ones) meant a little more 11th houryness than usual. As a result I&#039;m not too happy with it.
I think you&#039;re right: too much time / words on the interchange and not enough on the conspiracy.

Ah well.
Must try harder.
&quot;Three stars. Would read again.&quot;
;)

p.s. thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was fun, conspiracy theories ftw, and the agenty interchanges were vibey - I enjoyed their tongue-in-cheek take on officialese. I have to agree with Parfles and Cbraz, though, that the story felt a little unformed, like unbaked cookie dough - I wasn&#039;t entirely clear on what was happening. Conspiracy theories tend to be characterised by an excess of information rather than a dearth, and there wasn&#039;t quite enough here to get one&#039;s teeth in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! :D

See what you mean re scampi. The scampering was supposed to be from Smith&#039;s POV, which I realise makes no sense in the pot with the rest of it. 

Re unsure: for sure. You&#039;ll know when I do.
Ahem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re Smith’s employers: they pay well and give 45 days of annual leave.
:)

&#062; but can’t make sense of it quite.
Yeah, me neither. The idea is still kind of churning around in my head, to be honest. I never quite locked down exactly what was going on.

Agreed re Agent provocateur - see my reply to Rude above.

Fanks! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Traditionally? Tradition is virus, Mr Neeser.
Ahem.

Re Smith and Jones and food chain: that is indeed what I had in mind.
My thoughts for saying Agent a lot was that they were in the middle of a puddle of local cops, so were being a bit stiff. This isn&#039;t clear, though, and on rereading I do feel a bit too Agented.

Thanks, man! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!

Re palm: yeah, agreed. It was supposed to be along the gift-from-employer side, but no time or space to expand on it. Perhaps I should just make it Palm. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this a lot. It was light and fun, in a creepy conspiracy kind of way. I actually enjoyed the slightly stilted agent-speak. It built up the formality and hierarchy of the characters. 

Because of this formality and control in the interaction, I was a little jarred by &quot;scampered&quot; as it didn&#039;t fit with that vibe. 

I was also unsure about the ending. I assumed that birds were being used to cover up what actually happened to down the flight (pun intended :-) but it wasn&#039;t clear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is fun - a little window on a giant conspiracy. I am left wanting to know more about Smith&#039;s employers, about what they are covering up - but that is good, and what you wanted!

I would have liked to have a little more twistyness about the actual accident - I surmise that birds brought the flight down by accident, but that the FDR would have shown something - but can&#039;t make sense of it quite.

Some of the dialogue felt a little stilted - I agree with Rudy, I think it may have been the overuse of Agent. I would have felt more comfortable with them using their last names without the &quot;Agent&quot; in front.

Thank you, I enjoyed it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero, the traditionally named Agent Smith, reports at a crash site where he then proceeds to replace the plane&#039;s black-box with another. He is about to cover up that birds caused the crash of flight 792.

I enjoyed the officious, agent-type banter between the characters. One gets the sense that Agent Smith is more competent — and higher up in the food chain — than poor Agent Jones. Good use of language for this (such as having Jones &quot;scamper&quot; off). 

I thought that they sometimes overused calling each other agent. For instance, &quot;Anytime today, Agent,&quot; sounded a bit forced to me.

At the end I was left wondering how Agent Smith was going to remove the bodies of the birds from the plane to finish the cover up, but also thought that this was a good beginning for him!

Fun piece :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool idea. Everybody likes a conspiracy theory (maybe the idea of conspiracy was planted in our heads by...)

Really like the movie-like agents and their formality and the differences in voice between the confident Smith and intimidated Jones. 

Also like how little is told or implied - I have a whole back story on my head.

Wasn&#039;t really happy with &#039;Smith checked the display on his palm&#039; because I had to think about it a lot and it broke the flow for me - it was unclear to me whether this was everyday technology in his world (seems unlikely in light of biro-scribbled) or a secret gift from his alien/hi-tech employers - either way for me too much is revealed in that one sentence - for me it reduces the sense of mystery.]]></description>
