		<description><![CDATA[Very groovy.
Just sentimental enough.
Sad but not pathetic.

I&#039;m with Doc re commas in &quot;I smiled too&quot; and &quot;I knew then her death was near.&quot; Semicolons feel more appropriate and give better flow. 
I&#039;m with Rudy on &quot;such sentimental flights of fancy were most unlike her.&quot; Perfectly pitched.

I didn&#039;t have a problem with down. Mind you, I grew up with an Eiderdown instead of a duvet, so...

I also really liked &quot;it was some time before I realized she was dead.&quot; Something about the day to day drudgery of long term illness and going through the motions really worked for me.

The technical detail adds a lot of flavour.

Me like!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with commenters - beautiful piece and not too sentimental! 

I saw it as a transformation but agree that Rudy&#039;s view is valid and possible. In a way, there is a parallel here with Docinatrix&#039;s story - the death and the transformation into a bird. Swap starlings for seagulls and you can read the chasm story as the dream of the dying ornithologist :)

Thank you, I enjoyed this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found this piece very beautiful and serene (even with feathers strewn about the room :-)) I completely read it as the mother slowly drifting into another form/life as a bird - becoming something else as she died. It is a lovely and very positive death scene. 

I loved the flowing descriptions of avian dreams and wished for more of them.

I work with commas similarly to docinatrix - by feel rather than a set of rules. I had the same problems with the same sentences.

Thanks :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s actually not about &quot;right&quot; versus &quot;wrong&quot; use of commas etc - for me it&#039;s about the balance and flow and cadence of the sentence. More like tweaking music than grammar :&#062;.

For the record, I think &quot;I tried to ask what had happened&quot; worked very well (disagrees madly with Rudy...) - the tentative failure of &quot;tried&quot; is an important modifier to the action, which is very different without it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very flattered that you liked it and glad that it didn&#039;t come across as too sentimental. 

Thanks for you punctuation help - I had changed and re-changed both the &#039;I smiled too..&#039; and the &#039;I knew death...&#039; sentences and was never happy with them - your way is definitely better for both.

Have since read up on commas, &#039;but&#039; and independent clauses - will get my &#039;but&#039;/&#039;and&#039; commas right in the future I hope.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you liked it. I never imagined the feathers would be understood as prosaically as from a collection nearby 
See what you mean with &#039;down&#039; - will look for a suitable (more technical) replacement.
&#039;tried to&#039; - Yes! Sometimes you look at your own work and wonder what the hell you where thinking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lovely piece of writing, restrained and evocative; I love the way it drifts between realism and the sense of something weirder and more literally fantastic. I think you undercut the potential sentimentality very nicely with the amount of technical detail you give on the feathers themselves - effective and well-balanced, and very much about the way that grief sometimes causes distraction into meaningless details.

I may have to quibble with your commas slightly, since I find some of your sentences string together comma clauses in a slightly unweildy way. e.g.:
&quot;I smiled too, even in her last days, exhausted by endless pain, my mother was still an ornithologist&quot; needs a colon after &quot;I smiled too&quot;.
&quot;After I had cleaned up I tried to ask what had happened but between the morphine and the pain she didn’t seem to understand me&quot; - possibly needs a comma after &quot;happened&quot;?
&quot;I knew then her death was near, such sentimental flights of fancy were most unlike her&quot; - I&#039;d use a semicolon rather than a comma, but I&#039;m unnaturally fond of semicolons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a story about Our Hero&#039;s mother as she dies. As she slowly succumbs to pain and morphine, feathers begin appearing around her room (she&#039;s an ornithologist — presumably she&#039;s getting them out from some collection she has), and it becomes clear that she&#039;s dreaming of flying.

Great piece, I really enjoyed it. It gives a good feeling for what the mother&#039;s love in life was. I thought the emotion in it was kept tight and restrained, which I think makes the end more poignant for me. Nice. 

&#062; not just down but also contour feathers and the long straight flight
&#062; remiges.
This is the only sentence I had a (very minor) problem with: I first read &quot;down&quot; as a preposition, and not a noun. This is a very small niggle, though.

&#062; After I had cleaned up I tried to ask what had happened
I think you could remove &quot;tried to&quot;.

&#062; such sentimental flights of fancy were most unlike her.
I liked this sentence: the way it&#039;s talking about sentimentality but with an ending (&quot;most unlike her&quot;) that seems quite formal, and feels opposed to sentimentality. And then the whole piece seems lightly sentimental, but maybe that&#039;s just me reading in to it.]]></description>
