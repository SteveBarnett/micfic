		<description><![CDATA[Love it!
Curious and beguiling and dainty and pretty.
The in-at-the-deep-end technique works really well and pulls the reader along.

I really dig the coded message system of drops and hairs and things.
Magical and incomprehensible.
Loved the tone / voice and: &quot;You will be impressed&quot; and &quot;What a romantic I have turned out to be!&quot; really worked.

Very awesome(,) lady.
:)

[And now we have a Crowley book to read.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this. It was magical and fey and very beautiful. It had an old-fashioned feel to it, through I think the usage of phrases like: &quot;modestly dappled&quot; and &quot;my attentions&quot;.

I also love the concept of crawling into the warmth of a cat and sharing its adventures.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I&#039;ve had some lovely comments on this one, making me want to never plan out a piece again!

The idea was that this is between two beings that have never met - yet - and that they follow this strange ritual courtship where each detail has a consequence that is clearly mapped out in their minds, but incomprehensible to outsiders. 

The milner should have been a milliner. I don&#039;t even know what a milliner is, now that I think about it! Maybe he should be a baker or cook instead. The people are all what they do, since that is how the beings think of them - by function, not name. 

The beings are spirits or fairies or whatever you want them to be!

Thanks for commenting.

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero goes about locating someone — a current lover, perhaps, or an existing lover, of maybe just a potential lover? — by running about doing seemingly magical things. Finally, they locate their Person-of-Interest, asleep, in a nest.

This is a very cool, magical piece. I enjoy the spell-ingredient nature of it: all the little bits-and-bobs that go into making the spell, the things that Our Hero has to do. The piece also has strong viewpoint that you don&#039;t break to explain things to the reader, even though the world works in quite unexpected ways. You did the same for your &quot;breath&quot; piece. I think it adds to the magical quality of the story and the characters. I like :)

Describing the spider as the &quot;false widow&quot; is great :)

I didn&#039;t notice &quot;milner&quot; until I spell-checked the piece. It is indeed a surname :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Think it is great. Suble and soft and full of flavours. And very sweet. 

Strongly reminds me of John Crowley&#039;s kind of brilliance - much described but none of it quite sensical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It does have a bit of a free-form flow of consciousness feel to it - I sometimes achieve something similar either at 2am, or when drunk.

Actually, minor quibble, now I come to think of it: &quot;the milner&#039;s chimney&quot;. Do you mean milliner? &quot;Milner&quot; is a name, probably a contraction of &quot;milliner&quot;, but to the best of my admittedly imperfect knowledge it&#039;s not a common noun. 

It&#039;s a testament to the power of the piece that I didn&#039;t pick this up first time round, it seems perfectly natural in place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Nice Lady! 

It is a high bit of praise, and I wallow in it. Bask. Whatever.

It is interesting that this is the one piece of writing I did not plan, at all, in the slightest. I had an idea for this theme that was based around excerpts from the memoirs of &quot;Chicken Man&quot;, a very dubious superhero who quotes from bad management textbooks all the time. It seemed funny in my head, but would not come out onto the page at all at the time when I sat down to write (at the 11th hour). 

Eventually I abandoned it and just wrote freeform. I had no idea what was going on when I wrote the first sentence, and then just took it from there.

So happy you like!
