		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Maximo. So, how serious are you about the gramma chequer? I&#039;ve tried two for openoffice, but they&#039;re both quite bad. One of them is the same grammar checker that wordpress uses. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tousled! Gah, that is the one. Although, amusingly, my software dictionary says that &quot;tussle&quot; can also have a similar meaning. Oxford disagrees. I need a grammar checker that can catch these things. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this. It began as a fantasy forest tale, beautifully described and segued into a dark monsters&#039; inc. I loved the descriptions of the monsters coming out and wanted more of them. 

A couple of phrases jarred: &quot;thickened moss&quot; in paragraph one and &quot;tussled his hair&quot; in paragraph 2. &quot;Thickened&quot; made me think of thickening sauces, not of thick moss. I wondered if tussled should be tousled; tussled made me think of wrestling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like this a lot. Just one little thing that jarred slightly was the repetition of &#039;bedtime&#039; in the first and second line of the second paragraph. I couldn&#039;t think of a good alternative to the first use, off the top of my head. The second use is really great, though. &quot;Secure in bedtime comfort&quot; is a great phrase, I think.]]></description>
