		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, dude!

I was sort of trying to get across the human-ness of the alien world (since a human is telling the story). Also: squirm FTW, it seems.

Re People at work: yeah, agreed. I wanted a &quot;I know weirdos who speak like that&quot; kind of thing, but space / time constraints were against me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Correct!
Ahem.

Re F1 &#038; 2: perhaps better presentation on my part would&#039;ve helped? The double quotage is not very clear...

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, please! :)

I had vaguely octopodian aliens in my head. Something about squirming and tentacles...
I&#039;ve got a thing about stories in stories at the moment. I think it sort of worked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really liked the ideas in this one, the 13th floor like stacking of stories is cute and tight (you really get to know what is possible in 250 words playing this game).

Love the alien descriptions and the general everydayness of the alien world.

&#039;People at work&#039; at the end seems a little aimless to me, wouldn&#039;t have made much difference if it were absent. Perhaps the father might justify that Aliens don&#039;t know how we speak - an option that has the advantage of explicitly clarifying the story within a story aspect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is about a father telling a story about aliens in a hospital who are, in turn, telling themselves a story about human explorers on an alien planet.

Female1 and Female2 are the humans in the tale, but when they were first mentioned I thought that they were patients in the hospital.

I enjoyed the description of the aliens, their shuffling and squirming. As Cara said, it was very effective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this. It has so many levels, and I loved the last jump out to something like our world. It works so well because you have made the alien world seem so real. The aliens are described only very slightly but vividly enough that I had a wonderful internal picture of them. I particularly liked this sentence: &quot;They squirmed against each other, heads and arms and legs becoming coils of smooth green skin, then they calmed.&quot; It made me smile a lot.]]></description>
