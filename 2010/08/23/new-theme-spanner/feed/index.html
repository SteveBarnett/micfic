		<description><![CDATA[Oh, hooray! If everyone agrees, this means I don&#039;t have to dredge up a new &quot;Spanner&quot; story, I got this one down to just under 300. (Possibly an incomprehensible 300, but hey). Which is just as well, as further inspiration has failed me.

I suddenly feel lighter and freer at the prospect of being without &quot;250&quot; as a sort of bogeyman!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I confess I&#039;ve been working with 200-300 as a guideline from the beginning - just a natural aversion to rules I suspect. Still think that Doc or who ever should feel free to go up to 350 if that&#039;s going to get them the writing they want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel that I should say something as everyone else has. Except that I don&#039;t really mind much: the opinions below are not strongly held. 

- I am somewhat nervous about a shorter word limit, and would prefer a longer one if we change it around a bit.

- I like the idea of everyone being on the same word limit for similar reasons to parfles (everyone working on the same challenge and the variety that is generated), but also agree that this could be quite flexible. Maybe the range of the word limit should be defined as 50 on either side - 200 to 300, so we can be sure that the parameters aren&#039;t squishing creativity rather than challenging it?

That&#039;s all for now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[aargh! I have the reverse problem: the word limit means I take more time, not less. But I will go with the general flow if everyone is enjoying the 250-discipline. Just no guarantees that I&#039;ll manage anything for this topic, as I say I&#039;ll have to start from scratch.]]></description>

And I like the idea that it remains 250 words but there is the option of having longer [shorter] story in a separate section.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[My reply seems to have lost some RHS, so reposting here: ]

Yes, I have opinions, and communicate them via muttering to husband. Very effective.

My view on length:
- micfic is micro – we are meant to be struggling with squeezing it in under the word limit. I have learnt a lot from this about how little is necessary to tell a story, and how much of what I write has little power and can go! I’d like to leave it at 250 for the foreseeable future. Maybe review once per year 
- Agree (and even own) stv’s point – I really want to (and try to) comment on each micfic. I so value all of your comments! Longer micfic will take more time to analyse and comment, and I’m topping out right now.
- I like the uniformity of length as we are all faced with the same challenge, but respond so differently – it’s fascinating!
- I have always liked the idea of letting people be as creative as they like as long as they post the 250 word story too. Post the 350 word version separately! Post a 2000 word version! Post a 500 word story that is a completely different take on the theme! I would like to create a category called “extra homework” (or something), and let the creative outlets flow that way.

that’s all my cents.

No, wait, @extemp and maybe for another discussion: re 280 words – I have always interpreted the 250 as “anywhere over 220 and under 290″ or something like that. I don’t see anything wrong with 280 and it is within totally acceptable parameters for me. Views from others?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re uppage: indeed. I was discussing this with Parfles last night and she hit one of the nails on the my head (erm): time. If we up the word limit too much, keeping up with reading and commenting will be even harder - I already struggle with the 250s! And I want to give MicFic the attention it deserves :).

Other considerations: keep the MicFic canon short, but allowing fanfic. There&#039;s nothing to stop peeps writing longer versions on a Theme elsewhere (or here), but not as a Submission.

Re tat: pics or it didn&#039;t happen? I shall see what I can do.]]></description>
