		<description><![CDATA[Ha ha, snap re RSS. :)

The vibe for me is that this whole process should be as simple and quick as possible, i.e. no discussion / voting on themes. Just one person picking one (every few months, with current numbers). We are all busy, so it seems to make sense to start with a little bit of time commitment and see what happens next.

If we find that we want a higher word limit, then maybe a longer limit would be better and also some sort of discussion on themes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re 1: we could do Themes &#062; Ideas and Themes &#062; Announcements to separate the two types.
However, I had a vague plan not to do any kind of crowd-sourcing or discussion malarkey for Themes. I want to keep the two week time frame and not give anyone a chance to &quot;cheat&quot; by starting early :). Of course, if all but the suggester vetoed Space Cheese, then we would call a redo! (ahem. Was &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; going to make it Galactic Fromage for the real theme... mutter, grumble)

Re 2: might be an idea to keep it small for now, then once we&#039;re rocking and rolling (i.e. once we&#039;ve streamlined the process / categories, etc.) bring others into the fold.
I get the feeling that more people will result in a higher percentage of submissions - which would be A Good Thing TM. See previous conversations re Social Contract... ;-)

Re 3: indeed we can. Just add &lt;strong&gt;/feed&lt;/strong&gt; to the end of the category URL (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;/category/general/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/category/general/&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;ve added links to Feeds, including the General category, to the sidebar. We can update with more feeds as we go along.


What about the rest of you fictional people?
By which I mean other members of the gang, and not the voices in my head.
Um...]]></description>
