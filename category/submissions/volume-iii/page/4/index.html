		<p>Tommy Marchand smiled to herself as she leaned on the ship’s railing and gazed out to sea. Her present job was so beautifully meta. Here she was <em>on</em> a ship, <em>being </em>shipped like the cargo in the hold; at the same time, she herself was shipping cargo – her own body a vessel that mimicked the ship’s function. Except that the ship was still under the control of the captain…</p>
<p>As this thought crossed her mind, she felt herself slipping and knew that soon she would lose control again. Strangely enough, this did not scare her. Even the first time it happened had been pleasant. That was yesterday, three days since the hump had been extruded and filled. She had been resting in her cabin when the previously ghostly consciousness living inside her (the one that should have stayed under until well after the ship docked at the other end) suddenly became one hell of a lot stronger. Even as she felt herself becoming the ghost and the child rising, it was almost a relief to lose control.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>When it was discovered that a passenger and lifeboat had disappeared, a search party was immediately organised. It was a couple of days before she was found drifting off the coast of Malaysia, far outside the projected search area and almost dead from starvation. It took a little longer than it should have done to identify her, since along with a surprising amount of weight, she appeared to have lost the hump which was listed as her most distinguishing feature.</p>

		<p>“Morning, Lance. Sorry, I know it’s early, but it’s … no, not an emergency really, the cats are fine, promise. No, they are. Yes, I’m not just saying that. They’re lovely, and we’re getting on really well. They really like salmon. Um, oops, yes, I do remember now, but honestly, the kibble must be so <em>boring</em>. We’re really good friends now.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, bad luck, that’s what you get if you drag in family members to house-sit for you at the last minute and brief them in five minutes flat<em>. </em></p>
<p>“No, well, it’s no trouble really, your house is very comfortable, although I have to say some of your art is really weird. Does Aunt June know you’re into this esoteric stuff? She’ll have kittens.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Lance, I’m calling because your cats are <em>strange</em>. Have you been training them or something? They won’t let me out of bed this morning, I’m just lucky my cell was in reach. All three of them are sitting here looking at me, and if I try to move they climb on me. Grimoire <em>bit</em> me when I tried to move her. Honestly, Lance, that’s not <em>normal</em>, she’s perfectly sweet usually.</p>
<p>“I meant to ask you if you have earthquakes here, I swear…  Holy shit, Lance, their eyes are glowing! You have vampire cats with glowing eyes! What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p>“You’re making no sense, of course this shouldn’t be happening, but what do astrological conjunctions have to do with anything? I don’t care if they’re not right. Your cats are doing something weird and … Lance! Shit! This bed is moving! How can the bed be moving?</p>
<p>“Oh, God, Lance, where’s the bedroom? I’m floating! Me and the cats on the bed like a boat, and we’re floating down a river. It’s a purple river and the bed is floating on it. The trees are singing. What the hell do you put in your water, LSD?</p>
<p>“Lance? Lance? Are you there?</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>

<p>“Scariest thing, hey? That might be too much for you—sure you’re old enough?”</p>
<p>“Grandpa! I’ve already kissed a girl!”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, in that case—</p>
<p>“Let’s see. Well, when I was still an unmasked apprentice—maybe 210, 220 odd years ago—my master and I were in the Fuligin marshes. I was young, but I’d thought I’d seen everything, you know? I was a Pariah’s apprentice, as wise as the hills—”</p>
<p>“Grandpa?”</p>
<p>“Wool-gathering. Sorry. That’s what old age does to you.</p>
<p>“We were hunting zoëleiche, the two of us in a small boat, rowing in the shadows of those black, weeping trees. The zoëleiche had gathered in small groups, mining the muds for I can’t remember what occulted thing. We killed the zoëleiche as we found them, set them aflame.”</p>
<p>“Did they attack?”</p>
<p>“Hells, no. Zoëleiche are mindless—but the lore-wise who raised them, now they were dangerous. We discovered them on an unlit barge, coloured black as pitch, as night. Can you picture that? A ship as dark as death? The smell of corpses and embalming fluids lingering behind it, like the smell of your mother’s cooking?”</p>
<p>“You’re spoiling it!”</p>
<p>“Yes yes. Now, we followed that ship to a village built on stilts at the Fuligin’s peaty heart. A village full of corpses and lore-wise creating zoëleiche polyptych out of severed limbs.”</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>“Burnt it. All of it. I’d never seen Master Gabriel so—wrathful. He turned the air itself into an ocean of flame. The waters boiled, the trees were torn, shredded, ashed, and the ashes consumed.”</p>
<p>“So you won?”</p>
<p>“—my bladder’s killing me. Help me up.”</p>

		<p>The director had called the group together in our largest consult space; he placed his huge scaly hands on the edges of the podium and deliberately cleared both throats.</p>
<p>“The Steering Committee insists that we ship the XN24 this cycle – and a committee directive is binding on us all.”</p>
<p>The silence was only broken by the Subspace Team’s stuttering giggle-squeaks: an involuntary stress reaction among the Aratoi. The director swivelled three eyes to glare at them: “You lot mislabelled Outcome References 22 to 86 as ‘failure to return from subspace’ instead of ‘pilot navigation error’. Are you trying to get me fired?”</p>
<p>The head of the Thrust Team limped to the front, his carapace still blackened from the testing incident, and said, “It is impossible, Sir. Did you not tell them about our thrust tests?”</p>
<p>The director’s claws slowly extended and retracted before he spoke: “Unfortunately all engineering and design specialists have been removed from the Steering Committee in order to streamline the product-to-market process. So<em> I </em>never told them &#8211; but they have handed down policy regarding <em>that</em> incident.” He read directly from a clipboard hovering nearby: “Due to the cost in equipment and danger to key personnel all future thrust testing will be executed in simulation only – associated danger or injury related pay or benefits will be retroactively adjusted.”</p>
<p>Timidly the new intern raised a vivid orange pseudo-tentacle:  “Excuse me Sir, but you must be aware that the design hasn&#8217;t been approved by Galactic Standards yet.”<br />
“I thought your clan-twin worked there: that’s why you work here.”<br />
“But sir, she can&#8217;t sign off on plans she doesn&#8217;t have!”<br />
“I think, for the sake of her clan-twin’s future, she should trust to our expertise. After all, the steering committee has declared the XN24 ready to ship!”</p>

		<p>It was quite possibly the best thing I had ever seen.  It was perfect as it stood among the trinkets and crafts of the island people and it was perfect as a gift for the man who has everything and wants for nothing.  It was intricately carved with exquisite detail and inlaid with mosaic of glass and stone in all the colours that sparkled in the tropical sunlight.  It was large and made a statement with its bold and daring images.  It would look good in his dull and white house where all the surfaces were smooth and slick, endlessly polished and buffed into an unnatural shine.  This piece was organic and ready to shake that household into life.</p>
<p>I stepped forward to take a closer look and became more convinced that it was what I wanted for him.  Unconsciously determined to buy it even as my mind pretended to think it over – price, size, suitability.  Just motions my mind went through letting me think I was in control.  I wanted it.  I was going to buy it.</p>
<p>However, it was more than I would have liked to pay but really, how often does a gift so perfect just happen across your path?  Not often.  And it was likely, I would be able to bargain the seller down a bit.</p>
<p>I drew breath and asked,</p>
<p>“Do you ship?”</p>

<p>Craig stood looking at the offending object in the mirror.  Someone had mentioned it the other day but quickly brushed it off as a joke.  But Craig had spent a little time each morning before work looking for the silver hair and this morning he found it.  Or rather found them.</p>
<p>It was worse than he thought.  Craig counted seven.  Seven silver hairs hidden among in his well maintained do.  It was not a good sign.  As he dug out the tweezers to remove the offending hairs he wondered whether he was vain enough to dye his hair.  It seemed extreme but, at 28, to have seven silver hairs seemed excessive and it worried him.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be better to check his hair everyday and pluck the offending hairs as he saw them.  The plan had merit but as he grew older, he knew he would start to lose his hair.  And plucking wouldn’t help that situation.  It was a tough call – silver or bald.</p>
<p>As with every decision, there were pro and cons.  But both his decisions were heavy with cons and quite light on pros.  Tricky, tricky&#8230; He may have to think about it further.  No need rush into such a tender choice.  Time was not on his side but he did have a little bit to play with.  It was only seven silver hairs.</p>
<p>But still&#8230; Seven silver hairs&#8230; Need to think about this&#8230; Seven though&#8230;</p>

		<p>My skin reflects shadows of the jungle. Deep jade greens and umber skip over my new surface, chasing each other like butterflies. My hand, its virgin nevus  splayed between my fingers as if it wants to web, looks alien; a messenger from their world.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”<br />
“Not really. It throbs a little.”</p>
<p>It swells and rises with the tides of another world. It feels their sunrise and the direction of their wind, wet and pregnant with spores. It thrives on the rhythms of alien moons as it gnaws its way up my elbow.</p>
<p>“Do you retain sensation? Do you feel this?”<br />
“Yes. A stabbing pain. Sharp.”</p>
<p>The pain is like a story told by someone else, told to a hand that picks kauma berries from inside a ripe solar cluster, a meaningless story hardly worth repeating.</p>
<p>“You are very brave, Miss Levy. This mission is invaluable to &#8211; ”</p>
<p>The silver sheath is spreading up my shoulder. Every day, I am a little less human, a little more myself. Reflections chase each other up my breasts, down my shoulder blades: yellow flares like lantern eyes, the deep burgundy of the night sky.  Electric bursts of lightning spread down my belly, tantalising and sharp.</p>
<p>“The Kaai expect you. They will probably send a ship. We don’t understand everything, but –“<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a mirror in my room. I like its duplicity, its pretence of companionship. I look into myself through its warped surface, and I am looking into a jungle. The Kaai welcome me with sweet water and soft leaves.</p>
<p>They call me Silver, for the colour of the reflections of the cities of Earth that forever chase each other over the surface of my skin.</p>

		<p>Where water and moon meet,</p>
<p>Where the waves lap at your feet,</p>
<p>There, distilled from salt and brine,</p>
<p>The path to silver you will find.</p>
<p>Moonlight turns things into silver; everyone knows that. What everyone doesn’t know is that it runs deeper than appearance. I didn’t know it until I came to the young witch. Normally I would never have gone there, and I still feel somewhat foolish for following her instructions, if that’s what you would call the rhyme she gave me. But I’m desperate. I need pure silver and it is surprisingly hard to find here. Or perhaps it is not that surprising, given who owns the land.</p>
<p>And that is the root of the problem. The only way to deal with them is pure silver and things go very wrong if there is any impurity. I looked everywhere, examined countless antiques, coins and household goods, but none of them was right. So I went to the witch. That was another surprising thing: I knew she was young, but she must have been about twelve. That’s what made her really creepy, and that, oddly enough, is why I think this will work. It takes power and knowledge to be that creepy, even for a child.</p>
<p>So, I will collect the things that wash out of the sea when the next spring tide and full moon meet. Then I will boil them down under the moonlight over a covered flame until all I am left with is pure silver. Then I will act.</p>

		<p>He bends over me as I lie on the bed, gasping for breath: a dark-haired youth, thin and intense, but even through my panic I feel his shy charm, like one of the rarer gazelles. His hands on my throat are healer’s hands, long-fingered, gentle, fiercely precise. My breathing eases; the detached compassion of his gaze relaxes into a smile, but his face is drawn.</p>
<p>When we stand before the village for our handfasting it is only a year after our meeting, but there are white threads in his dark hair. He looks at me fondly, the pain of others already lining his eyes. He is difficult to love, but I have loved him from the first. I’m not sure he reciprocates, not in the way I feel: it isn’t in him. I don’t expect it.</p>
<p>Two winters later there is the fever in the village. He goes from house to house, his hands cooling and stilling the hectic blood of the sufferers. When it’s all over and most are saved, there are silver wings over his ears. He looks distinguished.</p>
<p>I am still a young woman when our daughter is born. As he holds her, his face alight, his hair has lost most of its dark. When the mayor’s son was dreadfully trampled by a horse he put him patiently back together, but he staggered from the room silver-haired and spent.</p>
<p>Now our daughter lies in the darkened room, five years old, fading fast. My love will go in to her, a white-haired old man. I will wait outside. She will come out to me, cured, and we will go on together, mother and child, without him.</p>
<p>All gifts have their price. He is happy to pay, but I find it hard.</p>

		<p>I tip my hat back and take a gander at the clock on the far wall.<br />
Time for me to make my rounds; make sure folks ain&#8217;t disturbed during the night.<br />
I spit out some chewed-up nail, take my boots off my desk and pin my five-pointed star back on to my shirt.<br />
Silver. Some kinda joke, I guess. From way back when the mayor appointed the first Sheriff.<br />
I yank my holstered guns off the peg by the Wanted posters and tie the cowhide belt up in a solid knot.<br />
Belt buckle&#8217;s been broken for a while now. Same engraved belt&#8217;s been worn for fifty years by this town&#8217;s lawmen.<br />
I mosey on over to the safe, crank out the combination, pull out and load up the silver bullets.<br />
No sense in waitin&#8217;. Don&#8217;t want to be caught fidgetin&#8217; if I get spotted.<br />
I take a swig from my hip flask, a special mix that Betsy at the Saloon brews up for us, and push myself out onto the streets.</p>
<p>Quiet. Like most nights.<br />
Real bright, though. Full moon. Makes everybody act the fool.</p>
<p>My teeth start to itch as I reach the end of Main Street. I start to smell things a little stronger than afore. Someone&#8217;s just around the corner.<br />
So I take another swig of the brew and draw my six-shooters.<br />
I see the door of the Undertakers open, creaking some in the wind.<br />
Dammit, Bill, I told you to fix that lock.<br />
I round the corner and there he is, all hair and teeth and hunger.</p>
<p>I raise up my guns and do what I gotta do.</p>
