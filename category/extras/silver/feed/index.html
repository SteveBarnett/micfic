				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was eight, had a silver sixpence for my birthday. Hid in the cellar from my no-good cousins and my hands felt the hole in the wall. A slot, like my piggy bank. Thing is, it seemed to want somethin&#8217;. I didn’t even think, slipped my sixpence into it. The boys were on the stairs, clumpin&#8217;, but they lost interest, went off to annoy the dogs.</p>
<p>I plumb forgot about the hole. That bad winter was when I was twelve, we was out of food. Was in the cellar, hopin&#8217; for a last jar of pickled beets. The hole was bigger, &#8217;bout the size of my fist, and still wantin&#8217;. I thought &#8217;bout it, went off and found my Aunt Aggie’s silver that she left us. Four forks, two knives, all the spoons, seemed to do it. I poked them in and they went away. Them beets was under my hand all the time.</p>
<p>I was in the cellar when that tornado came over, proper scared. Hole was bigger, so was the wantin&#8217;. I lay there and thought promises at it; when the wind was gone, went and found the big silver teapot. Pushed it in, it went away. When my folks was back, told them the storm took it.</p>
<p>I don’t want to talk &#8217;bout when I was twenty-five. The hole was bigger, the wantin&#8217; was bigger, but it shut right up when I gave it the ring. I dunno how it figures these things. Maybe it liked the diamond.  That boy was always no good, anyways.</p>
<p>Few years later my ma’s sickness was real bad. Pain wouldn’t stop. I gave the hole my ma’s wedding things – the sugar tongs, the cake stand. We never used them. It was real big now, &#8217;bout a foot across, and needed more – took the silver from the thermometer to shut it up. Anyways, my ma died quiet soon after.</p>
<p>Now I’m sixty-two, sittin&#8217; here in my rocker, and can feel the need clear through the house. Few months more, my hair will be all silver, and I figure the hole will be &#8217;bout big enough for me. I’m lookin&#8217; forward to it.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/micfic.wordpress.com/657/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/micfic.wordpress.com/657/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=micfic.wordpress.com&#038;blog=13774973&#038;post=657&#038;subd=micfic&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
