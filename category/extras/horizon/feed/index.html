				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Between two worlds life hovers like a star, &#8216;Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon&#8217;s verge, how little do we know that which we are!”</p>
<p>Instructor Black was quoting again, she always got a faraway look when she quoted from old earth fiction.  Zendra gestured the phrase to search: ‘Matched: Don Juan by George Gordon Noel (1788 –1824 CE), 6th Baron Byron, AKA Lord Byron.’ The earth-born were obsessed with names: were there truly so many of them that names should be so complicated? Zendra’s mother named her Alice Jane Miller but only the earth-born still use long-form names.</p>
<p>She dug further: ‘British poet and a leading figure in Romanticism; celebrated in life for aristocratic excesses including huge debts, numerous love affairs, and self-imposed exile.’ She chirped her class-mates: ‘Today: sublime wisdom from a drug-head steam-tech playboy’ and followed it with her sig-glyph slighted towards irony.</p>
<p>Black was trying to explain the dead language but had wandered off into a soliloquy about the limited sight-lines of her youth. Each cycle the oldsters became more distant: each parsec they travelled made them more nostalgic, less present. It was getting dangerous to have them in charge.</p>
<p>As she read on Instructor Black appeared to be crying. Zendra exchanged glances with her classmates: life in the hostile vacuum is too hard to waste tears on a long dead poet.</p>
<p>“Of time and tide rolls on and bears afar, Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge, Lash&#8217;d from the foam of ages.”</p>
