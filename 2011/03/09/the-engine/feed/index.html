		<description><![CDATA[This is fun and a good foray into dialogue. I enjoyed the two scientists, ant their personalities came through nicely. My imagined setting was something slightly fantastic (some sort of FF scenario, probably - like 17th century with engines!)

I have suggestions as to how to make the dialogue flow better: 

- Agree with Rudy about keeping words and actions together to show who is talking.

&#062;&#062; William stood before his desk looking very please[d] with himself.

&#062;&#062; “Really?” asked Louis.  “You know[,] they have been working on that Engine for years.”
- I would leave off &quot;that Engine here&quot;, it repeats from previous. &quot;it&quot; would have been more natural.

&#062;&#062; “And you’ve been [here] four months and you think you’ve managed to get the Engine to work?”
- and again, &quot;it to work&quot; would have been smoother.

&#062;&#062; “It’s five months[,] actually,” corrected William.  “But yes, I have made it work.  I am just that good.” - this is great and made me giggle.

&#062;&#062; “Let me see,” said Louis[,] holding out his hand.
- You can avoid some of the &quot;saids&quot; by attaching an action to a dialogue line.
“Let me see,” Louis held out his hand. 

&#062;&#062; William pulled from this waistcoat with some flourish a stack of papers.
- This sentence is a bit garbled. &quot;William pulled a stack of papers from his waistcoat with a  flourish?&quot;

&#062;&#062; “Yes, and you will note on the last page that the test was observed by the Head,” said William[,] leaning forward[,] pointing.

&#062;&#062; “The Head of Botany,” said Louis paging forward.
- This was really funny and quirky, added a lot to the story for me!

&#062;&#062; “We are engineers, we make things[,] we do not grow things,” said Louis.  But he had to admit, the young man was right and he knew it.
- I would take out the &quot;and he knew it&quot; - not sure if it&#039;s William knowing he&#039;s right or Louis knowing he knows William is right. 

The only other comment is to use William/Louis less often, and think of other words. &quot;he&quot; can work in context, or other terms &quot;the supervisor&quot; &quot;the youngster&quot; - stuff like that. Just to break up the flow of William-Louis-William occasionally.

Fun story, I enjoyed it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoy Louis&#039;s drollness at William&#039;s OTTness. For example, when William comes in crowing about himself, and Louis merely says, &quot;What is it now?&quot; as though William does this often.

I did think that William was very OTT — more of a caricature than anything else; it does highlight &quot;vainglory&quot; very well.

I thought that each sentence and piece of dialogue being in its own paragraph sometimes made me have to think for a moment about who was speaking. For instance:

&#062; Louis looked up from the paper he was reading.
&#062;
&#062; “Yes,” he said irritably, “what is it now?”
In this case, Louis, who was acting, is now also speaking (but in a new paragraph). It&#039;s a minor nit, though.

&#062; We are engineers, we make things[,] we do not grow things
Thought it could use another comma.

Was fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this - living in the arrogant techie world that I do it was spot on my everyday experience.
The arrogance and especially the calm intentional way it is used by management is lovely.
I liked the style - not exactly realistic, more in the Dilbert direction - and how it carried the idea of this interaction.]]></description>
