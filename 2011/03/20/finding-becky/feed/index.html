		<description><![CDATA[Petulant! Oh noes! That was really not what I was going for. Oh well. Am glad that the &quot;cutting thing to say&quot; bit worked for you, though. I did always imagine that the stories about Gabriel painted him, in a way, bigger than he was — but only because they also leave out his pedestrian parts. I personally picture him as being all those things: what he is in this story, and the person that people speak about in the other stories. 

I wonder if we&#039;ll ever find out exactly what a Pariah is, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I do not like Gabriel! Was he always going to be this petulant or is it his bad luck that his reunion with Becky hit the Vainglorious theme?

Given the grandeur and the mysticism of all the stories about him, I was hoping he would be less pedestrian, less moany and unsure of himself. I find myself disliking him but also wanting to tell Becky he&#039;s not worth fleeing from, agonising about. 

If this is what you intended, well done, but it undercuts my enjoyment of the myth!

I found the &quot;these people are like my scars&quot; metaphor unconvincing. It touched the theme but I did not feel it made a lot of sense in terms of what the scars mean. Maybe I am missing the point!

I did like the &quot;That was such a cutting thing to say&quot; I thought is was appropriately sarcastic and worked for the character!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. I&#039;m glad you liked the whole story arc. Was fun to write! The pun thing was intentional, and perhaps a bit too OTT. Oh well. Will be interesting to see what others think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the story of a broken man returning to see a lost companion. He sits in a bar considering his past mistakes (although others see them as achievements) and life. Eventually he decides to go visit his friend.

I&#039;m going to miss Gabriel I think. Love this ending to the series and the closure of the first story. Enjoyed the interpretation of Vainglory.

A few issues for me: &#039;That was such a cutting thing to say.&#039; the cutting in association with the scars (which Becky cut into him) is too much the pun,not sure if you intended it but it jarred me.

&#039;nor no better landlady&#039;: seems to be double negative to me which would have been okay if it was a literal landlady quote but worried me.

Also like the symmetry of him wondering if she still wants to kill him, just as she wonders if he has come to kill her.]]></description>
