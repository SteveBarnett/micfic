		<description><![CDATA[Your pics are at the moment are paired up the the theme title page (and quote) as a double page thingy, although bits of those can be moved onto the same page as the image if you can make that work better. 

I haven&#039;t mentioned who came up with what theme, or any dates. Do people feel that&#039;s necessary info? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, I will (happily) do some sketches this weekend. I envisage them being pared up with something - either the quote or the title. If we can come up with quotes  and pics that match, pic plus quote on the left, theme (and anything else? whose theme? dates?) on the right. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would also miss the pictures. I was thinking, Parfles, that the image would not align with the quotes, but rather take up the majority of the page (apart from margins and stuff). 

To remove the blank page, I could always move the quote to the centre of the blank page. Or, perhaps, have the title on the left page and the quote on the right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would be sorry to lose the illustrations, although if you are unhappy with the idea of including them, obviously we&#039;d have to! I&#039;d rather see what you came up with illustration-wise and then see if we can find a quote to match the picture. The blank page looks a bit blank to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aaaand, here are my quotes:


Stop:
 I have made a display that measures all the time left in the world.

Ghost:
‚ÄúWhere do you think you‚Äôll go when you die?‚Äù

Gone:
This is a story about a writer trying to tell a story about writing.

Outsider:
‚ÄúStork Mating Habits‚Äù looked too well thumbed for its own good.

Cat:
A perfect cat, it was: those shapely ankles, those precise whiskers.

Eye:
Her clothes had been stolen from a hundred washing lines.

Subterfuge:
It‚Äôs there if you know how to look for it: the jellied currents of the air, the slackness of fur, the stiffness of a smile.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[argh. sorry. do not use tab.

2. I&#039;m not sure about whether the image will add anything to this, and also how to (if to) align the images with the quotes. I think it would be odd to have an image of one thing, a quote of another. 

This all leads me to propose that we skip internal images altogether and work with the layout as it is - blank on the left page.

As a balancing factor, I&#039;ll mock up some covers and reviews of volume I. Penance!

What do you guys think?]]></description>
