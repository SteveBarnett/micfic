		<description><![CDATA[*tips hat*

Re why: I tried to imply that the preacher was getting too big for his boots with the &quot;“I’m getting too good for this gig&quot; vibes, but obviously it needs some work. Perhaps Gibson needs a line or two more?

Re preacher the second: agreed. Will ditch.

I seem to be getting better at being creepy!
(Don&#039;t let my parole officer see this...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your summary is spot on. Yay!

Re second play-off: indeed it is.
My &lt;a href=&quot;http://microfiction.co.za/2010/11/21/the-eye/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eye story&lt;/a&gt; has a bit that takes place in the shop from &#060;a href=&#034;http://microfiction.co.za/2010/09/15/stopper/&#034;Jess&#039;s Stopper&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;m making a bit of an effort to do more of this since it appeals to my &quot;It&#039;s all connnected!&quot; craziness.
I felt a bit cheeky lifting lines wholesale, but it was only a few.

Re Taser: your spell-checker is off its rocker, Mr!
Taser like Bzzzzt! Like shocking. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Taser&lt;/a&gt;. A Teaser Taser would be something else... (0_o)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, thank you for the nod! I am feeling rather vainglorious about it... ;)

I agree with Rudy&#039;s summary of the story (for once!). It is very creepy, and strange, and again I&#039;m having alan wake flashbacks (the TV playing stuff from your stories...)

I am not sure of why the controller killed the preacher, I understand that we are not to know but I would have liked a hint. I&#039;m also not sure why he uses a recorded message (maybe it&#039;s because he kills lots of people this way!)

&quot;He sings out his last few sentences,&quot; - that reads very nicely.

&quot;watching the preacher on the CCTV. He signals his attendant to bring the preacher up to his office&quot; - the repeat of &quot;preacher&quot; jars - the first one could actually be left off?

I liked the final lines a lot - very creepy and disturbing. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero is writing a story that plays off of one of Parfle&#039;s. A tele-evangelist, who has the ability to control other people and provide them with secret missions, is called in to his superior&#039;s office, where the same powers are used nefariously on him. Our Hero then sits back and basks in his authorial magnificence — but on the TV a familiar message is playing.

Ha! I liked this. It&#039;s slightly creepy and kinda funny at the same time. Funny bits: the sitting back, hitting save, and thinking brilliant. Creep bits: well, everything else! But hearing the voice on the TV right at the very end stands out.

Isn&#039;t this possibly the second story where you played a bit off of someone else? Didn&#039;t you once having something set around a store that Docinatrix wrote about? I remember not immediately noticing the linkup in the previous one, but this one was nicely clear to me that it played on another story, from the title to the repeated dialogue.

I have some nitpicks:

&#062; taser
