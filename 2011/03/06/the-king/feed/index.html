		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, RudeBoy.

&#062; historically always an alien impostor
That&#039;s my feeling, for sure.
&quot;No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.&quot;
:)

&#062; the charactersâ€™ alien nature
Did you also spot &quot;many moons ago&quot; near the beginning. Actual moons, man! Ahem.


&#062; And wooh! Tags!
You set a fine example for us, sir.
I&#039;m a big proponent of meta-data thingies. Unfortunately I&#039;m also incredibly lazy... :-/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A group of tentacled aliens have some unspecified (but I&#039;m assuming not nice) goals for Earth. They go about working towards these goals by having one of their own dress up as Elvis. It&#039;s not clear whether he&#039;s just impersonating Elvis, and that Elvis was once human, or if Elvis was never human and always an alien ploy. I like the idea that he was kidnapped, though, and was historically always an alien impostor :P

I enjoyed the slow reveal of the characters&#039; alien nature. I thought mentioning that &quot;an extra body was shipped in&quot; was a good, not-exactly-spelling-it-out-but-signalling-something-is-odd start to it.

While I was reading this I had images in my head of that Elvis in the Army movie he did. Not sure I&#039;ve ever seen the movie, though.

And wooh! Tags!]]></description>
