		<description><![CDATA[How... topical. ;)

A woman wants to take a parenthood competency test and as part of this receives a baby facsimile as a testing device. She becomes very attached to the device and does not want to return it, even though doing so would let her receive a permit to have a (real) baby. 

Lovely and creepy and quite uncomfortable. Great voice on the mother; her obsession with her babyblue is quite clear. And odd.
Talk of the grant made me think of Lundun Chavs and council estates. Innit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero wants to be a mother; she&#039;s been given an artificial child as a test to see whether she can qualify for a &quot;pregnancy&quot; permit of some kind. However, Our Hero becomes overly attached to the testing device, and is unwilling to return it â€” even though returning it is required in order to get her permit.

Nice voice. The &quot;ain&#039;t&quot; and the talk of a grant made me think that the narrator was possibly a high-school kid, or someone very young.

I thought that the mother had some great psycho vibes when she&#039;s telling the doll that she wouldn&#039;t be returning it. I think the voice she explains it in sounds obsessed and unwavering. I liked it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great.  A perfect example of how passing a test really does mean nothing.  Passing tests of knowledge and knowledge from experience are very different and even then it all means nothing somewhere along the line.]]></description>
