		<description><![CDATA[This is a piece around fashion, where a fashion designer, Mario, has been involved with the development of a new blue fabric — only wearing this fabric might be possibly addictive (&quot;never goes anywhere without wearing something in the new fabric&quot;) and ultimately fatal. The fabric, however, has already been widely sold before the truth about it is discovered.

I very much enjoyed this, with its slow building of this story through the different voices. I like the feeling of everyone being caught up in their own little worlds: the story is what we see between their self-obsessed viewpoints. 

I do have a personal nitpic with the idea of a &quot;science team&quot;, especially one that doesn&#039;t want publicity. It rang somewhat untrue to me. Personally, I would have called them a &quot;research group&quot; or maybe something more specific (chemists? chemical engineers? — but I&#039;m not sure what is appropriate). Not wanting publicity implies that they have all the funding that they want (which is unlikely), and, to a degree, it implies that they&#039;re not publishing anything. Not publishing implies that they&#039;ve removed themselves from the scientific community and are somewhat lacking as scientists. I am very possibly overreacting :P Unless you want engineers instead of scientists :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Development team would be better, definitely. Any mention of &quot;science&quot; gives me V flashbacks (completely appropriate here, actually.)

I meant to say one more thing - when playing with dialogue snippets, consider using fragments rather than full sentences - it&#039;s not how people write, but it&#039;s often how they talk. E.g. &quot;She’s chalk-white and has lost about twenty pounds&quot; vs &quot;Chalk-white and lost about twenty pounds.&quot; iyswim. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your points are well taken, madam :&#062;. I tend to write a first version which I&#039;m terrified is too opaque, and then go back and fill out the hints so they&#039;re not too cryptic. Clearly I underestimate my audience and overdo it. Your punchier edits on some of the dialogue are very nice, I&#039;m doing that kick-self &quot;should have thought of that&quot; thing. I&#039;m not sure why &quot;science team&quot; is an issue, it wasn&#039;t meant to be futuristic, but to suggest that there&#039;s new technology in the new fabric - would &quot;development team&quot; make more sense?

My personal sense was that this was a sort of culminatory show after several in the season, so some of the comments are about tonight, others are about earlier - I&#039;ll go back and tweak to make that clearer. 

Thank you, though, very useful commentary, will definitely re-write this one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This made me chuckle.  

I agree with Parfles about the science team.  I think design team would have worked better - more vague, more open to things not said.  

I thought the dialogue worked really well.  Conversation snippets as you drift through the after parties.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m loving that you are playing with dialogue so much, and telling stories in such interesting ways. I loved the atmosphere of this - perfect fashion show (this is a fashion larp! with aliens! of course!) atmosphere, disgusting, fake, larger than life egos, it rings really true.

I loved &quot;get the camera on me, ffs&quot;, &quot;God Darling, have a canape&quot;, &quot;Mario, darling&quot; all perfectly in character.

I would cut more out to make the dialogue less expositionary (I say this often, so I might just be hypersensitive):

&quot;he’s doing things with colour that aren’t  technically possible&quot; - &quot;he&#039;s doing impossible things with colour, out of this world&quot; - the &quot;technically&quot; did not ring right in character.

&quot;…apparently she never goes anywhere without wearing something in the new fabric, quite an obsession…” - too heavy hinting for me, I&#039;d prefer &quot;That&#039;s all she wears nowadays&quot; or something more gossipy (less hinty)

The reference to the science team struck me as weird - do all fashion designers have science teams? There is nothing else to make me think this is futuristic, so the phrase confused me. I would have preferred &quot;I hear he has a team of scientists working for him, can you believe it?&quot; or something in this vein.

I like the sinister development of the plot through hints and oblique references, and would like to challenge you to make it more oblique still!

One more note: I wasn&#039;t sure if this developed over the course of one evening or multiple time slots. I thought the references to aliens and &quot;she wears this all the time&quot; and someone dying may suggest that time had passed since the initial reveal, but the form suggests one single evening?

I really enjoyed this, thank you!]]></description>
