		<description><![CDATA[Some group has decided to make a bit of money off of creating chimeras of people and dogs. Once simply placing a dog&#039;s head on a person&#039;s body had stopped bringing in the dollar, they attempted to make it talk by putting a human brain inside the dog&#039;s head (which remains on top of a human body). However, there seems to be some problem with having this dogman talk, and so the dollar has not been arriving.

The only problem I had with this story is that it wasn&#039;t clear to me what kind of problem they were having with the dogman talking. I assume it&#039;s because they plonked a human brain into the dog&#039;s head with no understanding of how a human&#039;s vocal apparatus affects speech (for example, &quot;having problems with its tongue&quot;). On multiple readings that&#039;s what I took away, but somehow it wasn&#039;t clear to me on the first time I read this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a story about an assistant who is working for a Prof Hojo. He is involved with a project to develop xeno-crosses: in this case a dog/human - he seems interested in the science but his boss is impatient and demanding and now wants a talking dog - a job that is proving difficult.

Enjoyed the &#039;just another boring job&#039; feel that you get from the assistant - especially the idea that he seems responsible for most of the work and Prof Hojo only needs results.

It all made me smile in an off-beat kinda way - just another post-grad sucker.]]></description>
