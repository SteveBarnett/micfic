		<description><![CDATA[Does it help to know that in my mind the speaker is actually the wolf, the pig &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the house? This piece is uncomfortably close to allegory, so I&#039;m glad the alienation thing was discernible. 

You are very right about the literal interpretation: the photo did some very weird things to my creative processes, I found myself having to account for its details rather than using it as a point of inspiration. Odd that that particularly literal response should also end up with a content-low scenario, but I think your point there is valid as well :&#062;. On the other hand, I&#039;m quite happy with this piece, for once; what it&#039;s doing is rather strangely internal and symbolic, but it&#039;s exactly what I wanted it to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This story is about a pig trapped in his well built house and unable to escape the invisible wolf that is on the inside. He tries to escape or summon escape but is devoured helplessly.

I liked the three wee pigs vibes and reinterpretation of the basic ideas. The paragraph around the wolf&#039;s motives is lovely, esp &#039;Some terrible lack, a gut-deep need, a loathing of its own rough and barbarous fur&#039;.

On first reading it gave the impression of lacking in any real content; would prefer if some of it was a little more obvious.
The themes of isolation and being trapped inside and unable to communicate came out on rereading better and I really like: &#039;The thick glaze between me and the world muffles me: I may as well be silent&#039; as a description of alienation.

Also the idea of the wolf being invisible left me kind of confused and jarred, I see why but it didn&#039;t work for me.

Interesting how literal the photograph was in your story as opposed to the rest.]]></description>
