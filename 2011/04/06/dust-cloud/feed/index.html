		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
I do enjoy my twists, don&#039;t I?
(And zombies.)

I tried to focus on keeping the language simple, and on a few physical details to get the feeling of the sudden urgency.
Sort of.
Thing.

[I think I shall have to make my next story about reverse cowgirl(s) so that I can maintain my dodgy quotient...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hooray, reverse zombies! (Like reverse cowgirls, only less dodgy). The terse, clipped, active language really works here, and you&#039;re doing your usual with throwaway ideas which suddenly click into focus as the twist is revealed. (&quot;Juicy snack&quot; is wonderful and horrible). This felt very real, urgent, atmospheric, I was vividly drawn into the scenario. The zombie twist is just a bonus :&#062;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
I wanted that routine feeling - glad it came out rightish.

I think I need to get a t-shirt with &quot;wonderfully twisted&quot; on it. :)
Or a face tattoo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liked this a lot. You captured beautifully the way that even the most awful situations can become incredibly normal if they happen for long enough. The characters and the situation rang true.

It was a wonderfully twisted way to view a picture of a pastoral misty lane. Loved the twist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! :)

I have a thing about zombies at the moment (And cowboys. But not mixed together. Well, mostly not. ), so I had that kind of scenario in mind. Vengeful human mob - most definitely. I wanted to put in more obvious &quot;they are teh zombies&quot; kind of overtones (What was the juicy snack?), but space was out.

Point taken re binocular tossing. Wanted a hurried feeling, but will think of something better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This story is about a community who are keeping 24 hour watch and defending against a ravenous horde. They appear at a distance on the road and the watcher wakes the defences and settles to it. As the story closes the story suggests that the defenders are somehow infected (with an unknown agent) and thus the attackers presumably a vengeful human mob.

I like the slow set up and everydayness of it. Keeping watch and the associated tiredness and trials come through well.

Had a physical visualisation problem with: &#039;He throws the binoculars back on the hook&#039; but loved similar everyday physical phrases like &#039;clipping her elbow on his way past.&#039;

Also the sentence &#039;She grabs her shotgun and her boots from behind the door &#039; is amazing in the amount of information it casually gives the reader in terms of their situation.

Enjoyed the &#039;I am Legend&#039; twistyness at the end but the general military tiredness was great.]]></description>
