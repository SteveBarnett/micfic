		<description><![CDATA[This story is about a passer-by being irritated by a artificial dog (genetically) who just needs to help him/her. The human rebuffs any offer and tries to be polite to the dog although makes it obvious she dislikes the entire idea of such a thing existing.

Enjoyed the dialogue, fun and light in contrast to the general creepy horror feel of the piece. Loved the portrayal of the post-genetics world.

Enjoyed the dis-utopian feel of the dog-thing - how the corporations world-view of humanity is it&#039;s only world-view. Think you handled the ethical issues lightly and elegantly - provoking without being preachy.

I agree with stv that the Master corporation is a bit emotive and confusing and would I have liked something else. Ending worked well - re-enforcing the dogs loyalty and absolute slavery to it&#039;s genes while also re-enforcing the reality that these abominations are here to stay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great dialogue, as usual, Parfles! :)
The dog voice is nicely balanced between human and mutt, and the uncomfortableness of the shopper comes across well.
The larger world of genetic mishmashing is very groovy, too.

I like Rovers as a name for The Things, but Master doesn&#039;t quite work for as the name for the company. Very minor quibble, though! Also like mechnik. Sounds cute.]]></description>
