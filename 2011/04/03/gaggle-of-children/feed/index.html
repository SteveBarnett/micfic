		<description><![CDATA[I liked this - especially the halloween themes - already a time of costumes and deceit - but making the happy children part of the scariness is clever and elegant.

Found this &#039;sentence&#039; a bit wrong: Too young, though, and that’s a complication.
But liked: Heartless and cold, not just the animal on the outside, but an animal on the inside. - thought this was at the heart of your idea and that it worked well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is scary and creepy, a good tone and a great Halloween story. I enjoyed the image of any child being one of &quot;them&quot; and planting real fear into the tradition of fake terror.

&quot;Sometimes that’s an easy lesson for them to learn — usually I need to beat them.&quot;
This doesn&#039;t quite scan for me - usually I don&#039;t need to beat them is what I keep expecting.

&quot;the more innocent — the less apparent guilt&quot; - the less chance of suspicion or something of the kind. Apparent guilt indicates that these kids feel guilty (but it&#039;s not apparent). I just don&#039;t think they think about what they do.

&quot;Heartless and cold, not just the animal on the outside, but an animal on the inside.&quot;
This sentence highlights the central problem I have with the story - I can&#039;t make up my mind if the children are merely tools or if they are evil in their own right. Messengers and petty thieves are not threatening when they gather on your threshold, and I see them only as that rather than little monsters.

Thanks for a great story!]]></description>
