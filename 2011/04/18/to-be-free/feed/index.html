		<description><![CDATA[Great piece - especially love the first paragraph - the idea of mist mocking and teasing is unusual but work beautifully for me. Enjoyed the mention of knowing which way people are going - even the smallest things can be taken away.

Got a good final hopefulness and upliftment at the end - imprisoned but not broken.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this, thanks. You captured the frustrated, hating emotions of the main character beautifully and I felt very sorry for her. 

I like that you don&#039;t explain why she is chained and how she will get free. I also like the way the mist personifies all of her woes to her - it rang true as a reaction.

In the sentence: &quot;...feeling the injustice of her situation gnaw at her heart causing weeping wounds that hadn’t time to heal before the chafing started again.&quot;, I found the physical description a little jarring because it was so visceral. I might remove &quot;weeping&quot; to make the comparison a little less shocking.

Beautiful emotional piece. Thanks.]]></description>
