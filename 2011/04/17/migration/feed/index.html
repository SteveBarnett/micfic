		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments. I did mean rabbit, but the story works for deer too :-)

I see the contradiction in the sentences about seeing the monsters - I should make the first one something like &quot;No-one had ever actually seen one and been able to describe it... &quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with ES - I liked the gentle duncton wood vibes and the slow reveal of who the characters are, and was pleased with the name - exotic but fitting. I thought the two sentences dealing with &quot;crossing&quot; and &quot;exposed&quot; were too similiar to each other (the ones in the first and second paragraphs). 

I had a similar concern as ES regarding the deadlyness of the cars - I would expect the deer to see them from afar from time to time so no one having lived to tell the tale seemed odd. 

Oh, I forgot: this is a story about a herd of deer migrating. Part of their route involves crossing a road - something they don&#039;t understand and are horrified of.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed the slow watership down realisation - starts so sci-fi-ish and slowly becomes clear. Great choice of name - at once fitting and misleading.
 
Had a bit of a problem with  these two sentences contradicting each other: &#039;No-one had ever actually seen one and lived&#039; and &#039;a young, brave buck managed to see one and survive&#039;.

Otherwise love the slow reveal and dangerous exciting world you outline. Especially liked the last paragraph with he first distinctly animal ideas and a string sense of forth-right , honest braveness.]]></description>
