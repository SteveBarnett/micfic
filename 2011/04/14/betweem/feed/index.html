		<description><![CDATA[This is a story about a homeless person sitting on a bench at the edge of a park. On one side of them is the busy main road, on the other a path into the floodlit main area of the park.

On repeat readings I had a different interpretation, however: someone is in an emergency room, in critical condition. The person pictures their situation as sitting on a bench, with paths leading to loud life and still, quite, death.

Very well crafted, especially in such a short space.
Micro microfiction is the new microfiction? :)
The second paragraph is really great, working the senses.

&#062;  It all seems far away somehow, irrelevant. It will always be raucous and busy in that place: it will never stop.

I took the ending as open to either direction (which I like a lot), although repeat readings do render the death path as more appealing (to me and the narrator, I think).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I admit to being pretty damn sad when I wrote this, I thought the ending was equally open to both interpretations?
Hmmm.
Glad it worked for you - is my shortest micfic ever!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I echo cbraz: this is excellent and really well captured. Extremely sensory descriptions, the hum of the er room, the serenity of the path - it&#039;s engrossing and real and very immersive. Lovely. I enjoyed the way the choice naturally emerged from the description - someone less ready to pass on would have seen the emergency room as life affirming, caring, and the path as bleak. Given the character&#039;s perspective, it&#039;s inevitable that they move on into death. They welcome it. Great story. 

Oh, and: this is a story about someone on the verge of death in an emergency room, who visualizes their situation as a bench between life (the er room) and death (a still path). Lovely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought this was fantastic! I love the way you caught the moment in time between life and death (or life and recovery?, but it felt for me as if the death path was followed at the end, perhaps because it seemed so peaceful and attractive :-)) Anyway, the title was perfect.

I don&#039;t have any criticisms, except the almost-petty one that I think urgent bleeps should have no capital letter after the colon.

I also love the way you clearly describe the situation to the right and left without any real emotional connection. I especially like the description of what each sense is experiencing in the &quot;To my right&quot; paragraph.

Thanks.]]></description>
