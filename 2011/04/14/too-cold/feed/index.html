		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this, with its gentle description of time passing (parfles&#039; use of dignity in the context really worked for me). I saw it more as about a stretch of land than as about the life of the trees, although on second reading I do see the focus on trees growing. 

The long and short sentence structures, and the juxtaposition of passive and active voice really worked for me in setting the mood.

I didn&#039;t find it dull - I thought it was lovely and gentle. I would expect, if this were a longer piece, for this bit to be the denouement or introduction to a piece, but for this length it worked beautifully as a stand alone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with ES summary - this is how I read it too. A lovely, detached vibe with no real protagonist other than nature. 

I thought the sentence with the steel grey was a little too convoluted to work, and would have put a comma between moving in, moving on. The central paragraph overexplains the animals a bit too much for me: the bit about them being the daily routine is unnecessary to me, it&#039;s already there. The sentence about the animals standing out ongdt the trees was opposing the vibe of the story for me - the animals are ephemeral, it&#039;s the trees hat stand out. 

But I loved the calmness and dignity of the story. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a story told over a long period of time from the PoV of the trees as life, humanity and climate change around them, incidentally including a brief appearance of humanity.

I enjoyed the idea and the way you got the sense of timelessness (odd how that photo inspired both of us towards eternity). Enjoyed the very non-human point of view - no judgement or opinion just the facts on what happened.

On the other hand the absence of character and narrative makes it a bit dull for me. Interesting but not intriguing.

Like the short sentence structure at the beginning a lot - really gives the open timeless feel you wanted.]]></description>
