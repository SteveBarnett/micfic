		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments. I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the style. I disagree about your nitpics, though, interestingly :-) 

&#062; But I&#039;m desperate.
The narrator is still desperate, which is why she visited the witch. But the desperate situation still stands. I also see her as not having followed the instructions yet.

&#062; none of them was right
You really confused me with this one and had me thinking. For me it was obvious that I was saying &quot;not one of them was right&quot; which would definitely be singular, but the &quot;were&quot; fitted too. I looked it up in various places, and it seems to be one of those grammatical situations where both options are correct (although a couple of sources do say that if the subject is plural, the verb should be, but it wasn&#039;t definitive)

Anyway, interesting grammatical excursions - thanks :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In this story Our Hero wishes to obtain a certain amount of pure silver, since only pure silver can be used to &quot;deal&quot; with a certain group in the world. Pure silver is difficult to obtain, so Our Hero has gone off to a witch in order to do so. She offers some cryptic advice, but Our Hero seems to understand said advice.

My favourite bit is the control of information, and the POV: Our Hero knows who controls the land, assumes that whoever they&#039;re telling the story to knows as well, and so explaining it any further is moot. Nice. 

I have some small nitpics:

&#062; But I’m desperate.
I&#039;m not sure about the tense: Our Hero has already visited the witch, and has already followed her instructions. Shouldn&#039;t this sentence be in the past tense?

&#062; none of them was right.
&quot;was&quot; should be &quot;were&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed the chatty, everyday modern tone on the piece and how it contrasted with the content of the story. Also enjoyed the traditional motives (silver to kill things, land owners of the area, witch) combined in very suggestive but unclear manner in your world.

Enjoyed the rhyme and how it contrasted with the plain spoken language of the piece. 

Also some ace and original ideas: child witch, silver free hamlet, moonlight and silver]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the calm matter-of-factness of this - the weirdness of the story is beautifully taken for granted, and the potentially over-romanticised elements of moonlight and sea and silver are neatly undercut. I also enjoy the way you don&#039;t give us unnecessary detail, and we&#039;re never quite sure what exactly the silver will be made into, and what it&#039;s being used against. (I rather hope it isn&#039;t actually werewolves, although the story would still work - the oddness of the events seems to demand something more). Loved the creepy child witch, too. 

I am unduly niggled by the way in which WordPress won&#039;t allow you to make the poem into a proper format without the huge gaps between lines. You may want to do something with break codes in the HTML. I&#039;d also italicise it. Basically, I have only superficial formatting criticisms ;&#062;. Except that, a propos of Jo&#039;s comment above, I think the poem is the one place in which you could fancy up the language a bit without losing your effect. Poetry really &lt;i&gt;shouldn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; be matter-of-fact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool -  as a conscious choice it does work after all, and I was in a very specific frame of mind when making the comment. I get very little of it on re-reading :)

Looking forward to more!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment. Glad you liked the poem - I had a fun making it :-) 

I understand your criticism of the language, but it was a considered style choice. As you say, there are multiple ways to tell the story. I wanted the juxtaposition between the magic of the setting and events, and the everyday matter-of-fact tone of the narrator - the magic is more normal for her than for us.

Since I really like this world I created, perhaps I will join the general movement soon and write another piece in the world, using a different style :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very cool - a really strange take on the [werewolf?] silver-fearing monster myth, the challenge of fighting things that cannot be killed except just this one way.

What really worked for me here was the quirkiness of the myth - silver that washes from the sea, the creepy young witch, the rhyme, the land owned by [whatever they are]. This is great and new layering on the familiar myth, and worked beautifully. 

If I have any criticism, it&#039;s that I wished the language would have been more part of that place - there is a lot of magic in the story and I wished that it had been shown more rather than explained by the storyteller, if that makes sense. What are the motifs in the story? I sense it&#039;s about the truth of illusions, and about purity? Once you play around with the underlying concepts, (whatever you decide they are), you may find a way of telling the story in a new way. 

I am almost entirely sure this comment makes no sense. What I&#039;m trying to advocate is to have an internal inner layer of meaning to your story which helps you tell the exterior story in a new way.

All of this is more a suggestion for where you could go with this, but not really a crit - it does stand well by itself, and it has a beautiful strangeness that really works. 

Thank you! 

PS. Loved the poem :)]]></description>
