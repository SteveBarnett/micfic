		<description><![CDATA[Nice. Craig comes across as vain and obsessed with his looks, especially with his flip-flopping and worry between the choices available to him. He feels kinda sleazy, and I know one or two people who this piece, in my mental image of them at least, captures pretty well. 

Some minor nits:

I thought that the first paragraph could have used a bit more punctuation â€” just a few more commas perhaps.

		<description><![CDATA[lol~  

Well, I started going grey at 18 so I&#039;ve long got used to seeing them.  It was fun to write something about someone obsessing over such a little thing.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this serious, absorbed and emotional internal monologue about such an arbitrary thing.  I can easily picture Craig standing in front of his mirror thinking this, and understand his perception of his colleague&#039;s comment. Partly, I think, because it is an extreme version of silly moments I have had in front of the mirror with going grey.

The repetition of seven silver hairs really adds to the obsessive feeling. In paragraph 3, the repetition of &quot;hair&quot; was a bit much for me. I would remove one of them.

Thanks, this was fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed your spot-on descriptions of male-vanity. Especially the short sentences : &#039;It was not a good sign.&#039; / &#039;Craig counted seven&#039; beautifully reflect the triteness of our internal dialogues.

Also something about him not actually making a decision at the end appealed to me - typical attitude to have.  I think I would try to eliminate the use of his name so often but the occasional repetition certainly works to give the impression he&#039;s the kind of guy who refers to himself in the third person.]]></description>
