		<description><![CDATA[I thought this was great. I really like how you create this dark fantasy world at the same time as you&#039;re establishing quite a sweet relationship between the grandfather and his grandchild. The piece is very evocative, but still economical.

The only very little thing is that the expression &quot;Hells no&quot; felt a bit jarring coming from the grandfather, particularly as he used the kind of old-fashioned expression &quot;wool-gathering&quot; earlier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed the princess bride story telling vibe - liked the way you invoked the family ease in the dialogue. I think the light tone and dark subject matter work pretty well together. 

I assumed the most terrible thing that our narrator had seen was Gabriel in his fury (as opposed to the evil undead barge) - but I would have liked this to be more clear.

Also enjoyed the ending, very unresolved - just a little slice of the conversation.

Also enjoying the serial nature of these I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;m glad you&#039;re still enjoying them. Was worried that I&#039;d got the tone in this one very wrong, and then began to run out of time to tinker with it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, wordcount, meh. The story is great, that&#039;s what matters.

You&#039;re building a legacy, I see - tiny bits of worldbuidling through these vignettes, I like it! The world you&#039;ve introduced in the previous stories was confusing but fascinating, and I&#039;m glad we are finding out more.

This is a nice step away from the intensity of the previous two. I love the tone - the grandfather and grandson perfectly captured, and the alien details fitting in with the universal way the stories are told. I love the detail of the weird creatures and their creators and the cthuloid developments - all very real with very little detail actually given. And I am impressed with the myth of the Pariah and how it&#039;s building up.

Keep &#039;em coming :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wordpress&#039;s word count feature is buggy. It never agrees with the word count in Emacs or Openoffice, and I just notice that wordpress counts something like &quot;youâ€”sure&quot; as one word rather than two :(]]></description>
