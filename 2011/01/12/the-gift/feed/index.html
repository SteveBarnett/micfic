		<description><![CDATA[This was enjoyable. My favourite bit in this was the description of the shopping experience of finding something that you really like.

&#062; And it was likely, I would be able to bargain the seller down a bit.
I think that the comma shouldn&#039;t be there.

I did wonder about how well not having a good idea of The Item itself worked. The descriptions that were there, though (some of which reminded me of advertising copy!), were fun, and ultimately I didn&#039;t really feel cheated by not knowing exactly what the item was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this. It is a lovely vignette about a typical situation, but you breathe life and magic into it through your descriptions of the gift, the man for whom it is intended (through his house, which is a lovely meta-ness), and the decision-making (or already made!) process. It feels very true to life that sense of having already made up one&#039;s mind and yet wanting to think carefully about it still.

I liked not having the gift completely described - just some tantalising elements.
Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.

I wanted the reader to decide what was to be shipped.  

And yes, I sometimes surprise myself at the typical everyday things I do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sweet little slice of life. I really liked the &#039;I knew I was going to buy it but my mind was still considering&#039; vibes - a very honest reflection of our internal processes.

Also like how much you tell us about the gift receiver - the description of his house tells us a lot about him and how the giver perceives him (he rather reminds me of your Craig from the last story).

For me it seemed that from early on the narrator had decided to buy it and the only real problem might be the shipping, thus the drawn breathe and key question at the end - but I would have liked this to be made more explicit (i.e. that because of it&#039;s size and/or the narrator&#039;s circumstance there was no other possibility except shipping) to make the end work better.

Really like the way you can tap into everyone&#039;s internal dialogue - it always amuses me how typically human I am.]]></description>
