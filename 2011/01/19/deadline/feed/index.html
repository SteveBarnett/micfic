		<description><![CDATA[I loved the bureaucracy in this, and the satire around the recasting of things to fit the political climate. Made me laugh :) I think it was quite well done.

I didn&#039;t have a problem with, &quot;So I never told them...&quot; I assumed that it was related to the removal of engineering types from the Steering Committee. Since there was no longer anyone in the committee to tell, he never told them. 

I also feel that there should be a comma after &quot;personnel&quot;, and possibly also:
&#062; Timidly[,] the new intern
and possibly also (but it doesn&#039;t stand out to much in this one)
&#062; Unfortunately[,] all engineering

Also, while people have been complaining about inconsistent capitalisation (I never noticed the one about the steering committee, though), &quot;Sir&quot; is used in the same person&#039;s dialogue both capitalised and uncapitalised.

This was fun. Thanks ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Product - I had been thinking spaceship of some sort - your idea for universe starter is great and I wish I had thought of it. Perhaps I will include it in a rewrite. I think a bit more length and some language tightening might make me really like this one so a rewrite is likely.

Don&#039;t understand wrt comma after future, perhaps my meaning is really unclear. The sentence might read better if I made like thrust testing was a proper noun and got a earlier comma:  “Due to the cost in equipment and danger to key personnel, all future Thrust Testing ...&quot;

Rest of your nits are clear and useful, &#039;timidly&#039; in that spot looks terrible to me now; I wonder if anyone else had difficulty with &#039;So I never told them&#039;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this and found it very, very funny. It was great to read something that is so typical of what one experiences and has heard about in our mundane world, yet transferred completely to a fantasy genre. 

I think you captured the business and technical speak beautifully, and I love the humour added by the descriptions of aliens. Especially, the &quot;Subspace Team’s stuttering giggle-squeaks&quot;, which had me giggling a lot.

I quite liked not knowing what the product was - it made the story more general and seemed somehow unimportant (like it doesn&#039;t matter what you are making, these silly political and bureaucratic plays will happen). 

I would like the Steering Committee to be capitalised consistently.

Thanks. This was a lot of fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the idea - transferring the business babble to an alien setting, and making the whole thing a lot more overtly evil - no double speak here or political correctness. The scaly boss works well, and the pointless bureaucracy is highlighted in its alienness.

I also really like the little alien details that come out all over the place, the characterisations of all the different race - over the top and cute.

I found the first reading slightly difficult - a little too dense, and the information was packaged in such a way that I sometimes could not tell if I had missed something or if the information wasn&#039;t given to me on purpose. On second reading, much fewer qualms.

I have some minor suggestions :

- &quot;The head of the Thrust Team limped to the front, his carapace still blackened from the testing incident, and said,&quot; - you could try the paragraph without the &quot;and said&quot; - the meaning will remain clear.

-  “Unfortunately all engineering and design specialists have been removed from the Steering Committee in order to streamline the product-to-market process. So I never told them (...)&quot; - I&#039;m not sure how the &quot;so I never told them&quot; follows from the preceding phrase.

- “Due to the cost in equipment and danger to key personnel all future thrust testing &quot; - I would suggest a comma after &quot;future&quot;

&quot;Timidly the new intern raised a vivid orange pseudo-tentacle&quot; - If you want that adverb up front, I would say it needs a comma after it. But something like &quot;The new intern raised a timid orange pseudo-tentacle&quot; may work better?

- The capitalisation of Steering Committee is inconsistent.

That seems like an awful number of nitpicks, but that is all they are - very small nitpicks to a very fun alien encounter. 

If I have one regret it&#039;s that I don&#039;t know what the product is - I would have liked to have found it&#039;s the starting kernel for our universe or something familiar that would tie up with the f*ck up of its creation... :)]]></description>
