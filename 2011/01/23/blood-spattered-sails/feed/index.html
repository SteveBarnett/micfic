		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s Quantum Leap! Only with a killer :) Great, nostalgic stuff. This piece grabbed me. I like the succinctness and the detail. For example, snapping a suppressor (rather than a silencer) into place, and swinging the muzzle down. There is no undue detail, merely specifics. I enjoyed this. Also, how action is often implied and occurs between sentences:

&#062; Two meters ahead, under a hedge. I open the case to see the usual

There are some places were I thought things could have been a bit more specific, for example, the &quot;few moments&quot; mentioned below:
&#062; The parents take a few moments to realize that somethingâ€™s wrong.
But that&#039;s a minor nit.

I like the pacing in the last paragraph; there&#039;s a bit of tension that  builds as he&#039;s thinking about moving further back in time. Then it ends with the short sentence.

Anyway, I liked this a lot. Two thumbs up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed the cold perspective and the sci-fi aspects. I like the moral ambiguity - I assume he&#039;s a good guy acting with wisdom through hindsight but nothing in the text actually speaks of his motives.

The small touches are lovely: &#039;parent took a while to..&#039; + &#039;old model rifle&#039; + &#039;pills&#039;
I find the suggestions without deep explanation (pills, jump, caches etc) very effective in this context.

Not much to criticise really (except maybe the very subtle connection to the topic) - snappy, fun sci-fi story full of texture and life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is wonderful - a bit more serious than your usual fare, a little darker, and I think the language really works with it. I love the title - after reading the rest, the image is very powerful. I see the whole thing done in silent black and white grainy film ;)

What really works for me is the methodical description of minute detail - the intel, the rilfe, the boy - a kind of cold and clinical description that really fits the cold distanced nature of the subject. I like how a larger story is hinted at - the pills are suggesting something is _wrong_ and in a longer piece would inevitably lead to major fuck-up on a future mission, but in this little vignette it&#039;s perfect just being hinted at. I really like how his plight - far from home and getting further - is so much more real to him than that of the little boy and his parents.

This works really well, thank you!]]></description>
