		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero is some kind of transport host person: she has a hump placed on her which appears to contain a consciousness separate to her own. This consciousness was supposed to be in some way dormant, but appears to have awoken and gained partial power to control Our Hero. Our Hero is currently being shipped somewhere, presumably to transport said consciousness; the consciousness, however, has other plans, and kidnaps Our Hero and takes our out to sea. Our Hero is finally located minus the hump — and, presumably, minus the extra consciousness.

Interesting to see multiple levels to the word &quot;ship&quot; cropping up. The sparse information did manage to intrigue me, and keep me reading. I like that while there is quite an explicit ending, its meaning is unknown to us.

I found the word used by itself (rather than a prefix on another word) a bit jarring. Sounds like Internet lingo, and it stands out against the language of the rest of the piece, which doesn&#039;t use any Internet lingo. But this is a minor nit!

I&#039;m not entirely sure, but it seems that this should have an extra comma.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely idea of shipping and escape. I like how little is told about our protagonist and what has happened to her.

 I liked the fact of the losing control being pleasant and the narrator&#039;s general lack of panic - very creepy. Think the formalish last paragraph works very well as an ending.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this - very cool self-awareness and plays on the &quot;ship&quot; theme in so many ways! I like the central character and her cheerful resignation, and I am very intrigued by what is happening to her - as of now, I have no specific idea but the story is certainly open to being explained in exciting ways!

I love the way it is not clear if this is the future or some sort of secret present (supernatural, alien, whatever) - it leaves a lot to the imagination, which works.

I may have preferred to find out about her conspicuous hump in the first paragraph to make its loss more startling in the last, but that is a minor crit.

I would also have used &quot;after&quot; rather than &quot;since&quot; in &quot;since the hump was&quot;.

A lovely and mysterious story - would like to know more :)]]></description>
