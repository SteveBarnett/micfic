		<description><![CDATA[This appears to be about a woman, Our Hero, who has in some way become a spaceship. Or perhaps she was never a human being (the last paragraph definitely suggests that for me). Either way, she is now being trained in the visualisation techniques required when piloting through space. 

I found the first person point of view interesting. When Our Hero is first introduced the narrator hasn&#039;t yet been; but the way in which she&#039;s introduced is very much as though she&#039;s being watched, only we can&#039;t tell by whom. Later we realise that there is another character (the narrator), and there is an interesting viewpoint shift.

I liked this piece. I thought it built up nicely, introducing Our Hero and her struggles, then showing the various ways she could possibly &quot;fail&quot;, and then finally showing how she&#039;s working through it all, in a way that the narrator (and we the reader) find unexpected.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you - I&#039;m very glad it worked for you. It was another one of those themes where I had no idea what to do with it, and just started writing (I suspect that&#039;s why the beginning feels chopped, but I managed to justify that through the developing story). 

I&#039;m always a bit scared to just write without the idea worked out, but when it does work I am pleased. Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like this - the surface sci-fi idea is great and interesting and the deeper ideas about what tactics one would choose to handle new situations and how they reflect on you come through very strongly in the mentor/student relationship.

I love the conception of the character (virtual mind with spectacles!) and the kindly, competent everyday tutor. 

For me the best paragraph was the one discussing how different student were the first time and how that reflects their long term successes. The end with the summoned book works very well to further this analysis.

I found the beginning a bit chopped up but see that the style reflects the newly created world.

Great micfic - a personal favourite for me.]]></description>
