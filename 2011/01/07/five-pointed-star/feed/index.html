		<description><![CDATA[I thoroughly enjoyed this story: meeting of wild west and monster tale in a light, comedic style. I love the detail in his clothing and the style of the dialogue; they work really well in creating atmosphere.

Like others, I have some confusion about the nature of the sheriff - is he human?, if he is, maybe the special brew does something special to him? But I kind of enjoyed these uncertainties. 
I like that the Saloon and Undertakers aren&#039;t named, and I like the sometimes stereotypical language, e.g. mosey - they add to the archetypical vibe of the piece.

Thanks, this was fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like cowboys :) And this was fun. Our Hero is a sheriff, and he&#039;s busy setting out to do a bit o&#039; peace keeping in the small hours of the night.

I enjoy that you gave characters names, like Betsy and Bill — they&#039;re simple names, but I thought they fit the feeling of the piece that you got going. I agree with Parfles about the Saloon and Undertakes perhaps needing names of their own.

The first time I read this I did wonder if Our Hero was himself a werewolf, with his itchy teeth and improved senses. But then he was wearing a lot of silver, and his werewolfiness wasn&#039;t stressed, so I assumed not. The second time I didn&#039;t think that at all; only ASpedition&#039;s comments reminded me of it. 

One thing that stood out for me is that many of the sentences begin with, &quot;I ...&quot; For example, &quot;I tip my hat ...&quot; or, &quot;I yank my ...&quot; or, &quot;I see ...&quot; Sometimes these sentences can be reworked to begin the sentence with something else, or even to remove the &quot;I&quot; completely.

Fun piece. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the tone - the whole cowboy wild west thing is beyond overdone and way into cool again. Really liked the mosey and chewed up nails and gander etc for this piece.

The fantasy element works well and I like the everydayness of the silver bullets kept in the safe. Paragraph structure really bugged me - don&#039;t know if WP just messed up your formatting or it was intentional.

My only crit is on the reveal of the werewolf thing - seems kind of clumsy with some strange confusions in lines like: &#039;Full moon. Makes everybody act the fool.&#039; and &#039;start to smell things a little stronger than afore&#039;

These distracted me from understanding in that it confused exactly who the wolf is for me.

The end and the undertakers place is great - like the beginning the super overdone ideas fresh and new in the werewolf context.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this story.  I liked the theme and the tone - it had me smiling from the beginning.  

To counter - I love the word &#039;mosey&#039;  lol~]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great - great atmosphere, great voice, really gets to feel like some distant place. The central character is quirky and salty and really gets under your skin. To do the Rudy: this is a story about a town in the west (all planets have a west! and so does the alternative past, and the future), where some people are werewolf type creatures. Some (like the sheriff) drink their special brew, keep their engraved belt on, and keep it under control. Others (like whatever&#039;s coming from the Undertaker&#039;s) just erupt into tooth and claw, and need to be shot.

It&#039;s a great world and nice tight telling.

Nit-picking:
Mosey - I don&#039;t like that word, it&#039;s too comedy for me most the time!
Saloon and Undertakers - I would suggest giving names to places to make the setting more real - the names can also give a great feeling of place.

I loved the belt tied into a knot, and the itching teeth.

Tell me, what&#039;s up with your paragraph structure? There is a single line break after almost each sentence, and a double line break before &quot;quiet&quot; and &quot;my teeth&quot;. Is that intentional? It looks a bit odd :)

Loved the story, thank you!]]></description>
