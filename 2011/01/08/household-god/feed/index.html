		<description><![CDATA[On the other hand, I absolutely loved this. The voice is quirky but spot on, and the story is pure delight in its simplicity. I love the &quot;wantin&#039;&quot;, it&#039;s so clear how you would feel it and how it would feel. It&#039;s perfect in that Stephen King folksy tale about something quite possibly sinister for most, but just-about-spanking-perfect for that old lady.

I loved that the givin&#039; was never quite miraculous - simple things that might have happened anyway, sometimes you don&#039;t even quite know what happened (like that young man, where did he go) but that&#039;s just right as it&#039;s told.

I liked the cousins &quot;clumpin&#039;&quot; on the stairs - I don&#039;t know what &quot;clumpin&#039;&quot; is but I can totally see them doing it. 

And the inevitable ending is bloody marvellous, and good luck to the old biddy with that - it&#039;s gonna be some folks bleedin&#039; version of hell, but she&#039;s gonna be happy as a pig in muck there, I can tell ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Quick explanation: I fought this theme particularly hard, and ended up with five possible stories based on it, none of which I really like, but two of which I didn&#039;t actually hate when I&#039;d wrangled them a lot. The healer one is my Official Micfic. This one is (a) too long, and (b) I&#039;m not sure I really like the voice, but I fling it at you in the spirit of what the hell.]]></description>
