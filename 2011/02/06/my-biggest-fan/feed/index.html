		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Roodles.

&#062; Cigarettes, drink and coffee are drugs he freely uses
Coffee&#039;s not a drug, it&#039;s lifestyle choice! Ahem.

Your picture of Writer Guy matches mine, and this pleases me greatly.

&#062; describing why Our Hero thinks that his books are trash
Interesting, I like. I shall see what I can do for Print.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!
Re deep fag: agreed, reads nicer your way. Will change.
Re pull, pull: agreed also. I think that hair pull sentence needs a rewrite.
Re grit: thanks! :) I&#039;m enjoying being nasty, it seems... (-_-);]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you muchly!
If I had more words I would&#039;ve had more grime, more detail, I think.

&#062; perfectly-depicted grumpy
I just imagined myself being in the same situation, either hungover or in dire need of coffee :D .]]></description>

Yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_wake&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/a&gt; was definitely a big inspiration. The slightly-off-feeling world, the stand-ups, the grumpy writer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got a great picture of Our Hero from this. Someone who, at least when it comes to their writing, is embittered, cynical. Cigarettes, drink and coffee are drugs he freely uses, and I imagine he judges people who would judge him poorly for using them so freely.

Like your piece before this, I enjoyed your control of detail.

&#062; I crash down into the seat and start scribbling in the trash that
&#062; I’ve oozed out for these people to devour.
In terms of detail, a word or two describing why Our Hero thinks that his books are trash would have been great.

I liked this :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great. Really nasty and gritty. I loved the way the character was developed, with the juxtaposition between him and his writer persona, personified by the cardboard figure.

In &quot;I take a last, deep, pull on my fag&quot;, I would leave out the second comma -  it reads better for me that way.
In &quot;I wipe my hand on my trousers and give my hair a quick pull about so that I don’t get mistaken for a tramp like last time.&quot;, which is one of my favourite sentences, &quot;pull&quot; is repeated from the previous sentence which jars a little.

I love the AIDS baby metaphor and the way his self-hatred comes out, e.g. &quot;Smug fucker&quot;.

I&#039;m not commenting on the last group (ship) because I&#039;m too far behind, but wanted to say that I love that piece of yours too and like this move to grittiness - it suits you nicely (as did your previous style, but this is very different and you also do it so effectively)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really liked this - the voice and the grimy detail are perfect, and the character is a perfectly-depicted grumpy (and probably damaged) sod. It&#039;s also a particularly creative use of &quot;stand up&quot;, and the cardboard cut-out has considerable metaphorical punch. Very nicely-controlled piece of writing, every word in its place and working hard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed this - very reminded of &#039;Bon Fire of the Vanities&#039; throughout - a favourite book of mine.

Great visual ideas and the cardboard cut-outs really work as a narrative device. I thought the perfect, marketing, clean image of oneself being described as dead and soulless worked very well at a lot of levels and gave easy insight into some complex angst.

Phrase that jarred: &#039;give my hair a quick pull about so that I don’t get mistaken for a tramp like last time&#039; - just seemed cumbersome and inelegant - perhaps &#039;mistaken for a tramp again&#039; would have worked better.

Phrase that really worked:&#039;cradling my latest book like an adopted AIDS baby&#039; and &#039;trash that I’ve oozed out for these people to devour.&#039;

Excellent, I like.]]></description>
