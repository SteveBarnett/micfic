		<description><![CDATA[I thoroughly enjoyed this in a creepy way. Its very effective, and you get the voice of the evil persuader very well. I love the capitals and the poetic form - they work very well. I had lovely visions of a very fat, lazy person surrounded by mostly eaten food and empty packets and crumbs in their lazyboy, with the cold alien light of a grainy tv spilling over the face and this hypnotic voice coming out.

No real criticisms - beautifully done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed this - great voice and pacing.

I found it Ballard / Phillip K Dick like in that it IS creepy and disturbing in ways that are not immediately obvious. The way it is obvious the speaker despises those he is addressing and thinks of them as lesser really works for me - like a over-powering parent instructing a child.

Initially the capitals annoyed me but I have no better alternative and I see the need to get the sound of the piece right.

I am glad you chose finance over snake-oil sales in the real world - you&#039;re too dangerous in this voice :)

Skilled, interesting story - more creepy than fun for me - but intriguing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I&#039;ve been reading &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot; by Darren Brown and there is a whole chapter on hypnosis that some of the language was based on. Mwa Ha Ha!

Also, good spot on the YouR. oops. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You really are indecently good at voice. This is vivid and compelling, and only initially funny - it very quickly becomes freaky as the satirical take-off of the evangelist&#039;s screed undercuts itself with the worrying hypnotic suggestion (&quot;As you breathe deeply the wet-dog-smell of your carpet&quot;, &quot;as you feel the carpet under you bare feet&quot; - although it should probably be &quot;your bare feet&quot;, no?). I love the way the whole thing lurches out of control from a standard evangelical rant to a much nastier Philip K Dick sort of scenario. It&#039;s a testament to the effectiveness of the writing that the gun is not in any way a surprise.]]></description>
