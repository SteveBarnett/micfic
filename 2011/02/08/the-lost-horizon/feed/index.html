		<description><![CDATA[I enjoy the image of someone&#039;s mind being as barren and empty as a desert.

As the others, I also thought this was a fairly abstract piece. I had not thought that he was resisting becoming a fire-element user.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this and really enjoyed the small amount of detail. For me, it was a completely abstract piece, which the visual metaphors enhanced. I didn&#039;t know what was going to happen to the man when the wall reached him, but that didn&#039;t matter for enjoying the world. 

I also liked his ambivalence about this.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was an interesting piece, and the calm desert/encircling flames are vivid images. I found myself wanting more clues, though, as to what the flames actually represent and why the dreamer should resist them so powerfully - the whole scenario is so abstracted it&#039;s a little difficult to relate it to anything real about the central character. 

Minor nitpicks: I don&#039;t think you needed to say explicitly that &quot;it was the desert of his mind&quot;, that&#039;s perfectly clear from your description. I think &quot;wondering of his situation&quot; should also be &quot;wondering about his situation&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As ES says, this is a very abstract piece which works well in that way - the space in your head. Reminded me a lot of &quot;the Cube&quot; (http://www.career-and-test.com/cube-personality-test.html) visualisation (which if you have not done is a very fun exercise). 

I would have liked to see some more detail about the inner world as that can convey a lot more realism even in an inner space type scenario like this one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think is lovely and abstract. The ideas of inevitable personal change and the rather strange neutral attitude towards it resonant well with me. Especially the combination or dread and fascination with the flame speak to me of my love of novelty and fear of change.

Really liked this little dream-piece.]]></description>
