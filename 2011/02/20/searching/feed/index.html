		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, man.
Glad that 2nd P worked for you - was a bit worried about it.
I seem to be enjoying being &quot;a bit dark.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[second person is very brave and I think it worked brilliantly in this case. It makes the hero&#039;s siren obsession much easier to relate to.

Loved the slowly building realisation about what he is doing and why, also the depths of his determination.

The twisty end was excellent, I love how the story supports the tradition in that they do sing wonderously while contradicting it in that they can fly.

Really liked the dark vibes that play off well with your style.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; My English teacher’s soul also wants to say “Interesting, but how do you consider the “Horizon” theme to be exemplified in this piece?”

It&#039;s one of those &quot;If you don&#039;t get it it, I can&#039;t tell you&quot; deals. ;)

[Also: ship, standing on, looking out at horizon. Not that much of a stretch...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!

I did second person more as a challenge to myself than as a choice for that to be The Right Way to do it, but I&#039;m quite happy with how it turned out.

Re faces that form: thanks!

Re long sentence: yeah, I concur. I think I&#039;ll chop it into pieces for printing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like your darker stories as well.  And they still have your signature twist but not so obvious - very cool. 

I&#039;m not that fond of second-person but it was still enjoyable :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooh, twisty, I like. Those the gods wish to destroy, they first give their heart&#039;s desire. Heh. The atmosphere, and the second-person voice of the main character, work very well - I like the note of fatalism at the end. You&#039;ve done some nifty things here with changing sentence length, really works.

Nitpick: &quot;in a bluster&quot; really didn&#039;t work for me, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s an idiom I&#039;m not recognising or a random bit of poetic diction, but to my mind it doesn&#039;t quite convey the right tone. My English teacher&#039;s soul also wants to say &quot;Interesting, but how do you consider the &quot;Horizon&quot; theme to be exemplified in this piece?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is awesome, dude! If I may say so, your new, slightly darker stories are working very well for me - you are getting more out of the language in these, and the language in this one is evocative and powerful and all those things.

I loved the reference to Nikos by name - it makes it more powerful than an unnamed shipmate, and all the oblique references to the sigil (it&#039;s not standing out but just fits right into a story that I would otherwise place pretty much in the here and now). 

I loved the description of faces that form out of foam and reflections - I can totally see that and see how they change too. 

The second person was very unobtrusive but fitting the story very well.

I thought the sentence about the nylon rope and the mast was too long to read comfortably. Otherwise no nitpicks.

Thank you! Great take on the myth.]]></description>
