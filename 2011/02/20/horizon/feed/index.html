		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the idea and the rather pathetic unemployed astronomer. 

Loved the general sense of lose and sadness; the idea of us being happier alone is interesting.

Enjoyed the end and the suggestion that for most people life goes on happily enough as it always had.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found this interesting - the concept that we are worthy enough to be be watched and scrutinised, that we are worth something in the universe.  That we actually matter :)  

&#039;All the empty&#039;, I really liked this line.  It appeals to my sense of the world and what we are.  Overall, I enjoyed this piece.]]></description>
