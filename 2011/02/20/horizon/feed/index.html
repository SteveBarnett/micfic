		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the idea and the rather pathetic unemployed astronomer. 

Loved the general sense of lose and sadness; the idea of us being happier alone is interesting. 
Thought the ipod line was great and really sad.

The idea of the drunk bitchin about the changes is great but for me the voice was slightly Over the top, to close to comical. 

Enjoyed the end and the suggestion that for most people life goes on happily enough as it always had.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found this interesting - the concept that we are worthy enough to be be watched and scrutinised, that we are worth something in the universe.  That we actually matter :)  

&#039;All the empty&#039;, I really liked this line.  It appeals to my sense of the world and what we are.  Overall, I enjoyed this piece.]]></description>
