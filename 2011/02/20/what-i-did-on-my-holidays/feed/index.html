		<description><![CDATA[Playful and cute: love the childlike fantasy. 
Good vibrant ideas: love the ship shrinking as it heads out and the pirate fleet+dog. 
I didn&#039;t like the sentence directly speaking about how much teacher expects - not because it was bad but more because it was mundane and broke the flow of ideas.

The barely told return journey is a lovely ending.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know, I thought a kid who experiences such thing would likely have such a vocabulary.  I thought it great - very Garth Nix for me, especially the Morrow Days.  It also reminded me of Twig from The Edge Chronicles.  Both are full of fun and so is this piece.  Very enjoyable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the whimsy and childlike logic of this, and the wild inventiveness; it&#039;s an endearing and enchanting world which is being presented, absolutely vivid whether real or imagined. It slips out of focus for me in terms of language and vocabulary - &quot;inventive&quot; and &quot;cryptic&quot; don&#039;t feel like words commonly used by kids, but the rest of the tone and feel (and the framing as &quot;what I did on my holidays&quot;) absolutely do. I&#039;m also not sure if the repetition of &quot;something frightful&quot; and &quot;something frantic&quot; was deliberate, but it jarrs slightly. Those are nitpicks, though - thank you, I enjoyed this.]]></description>
