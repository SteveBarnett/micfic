		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I have a habit of making sentences full of semi-colons, colons, parentheses and em-dashes, sometimes all at once, and then being completely happy with it all while I&#039;m editing. I should put money into a piggy-bank every time I use something that isn&#039;t a comma or a full-stop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice wanderers tale; scrub lands and desert seems classic scenes for introspection. I thought the idea with the badly carved wooden stick is brilliant and it has been haunting me all week (the idea that it doesn&#039;t matter how good the likenesses are because no-one else exists to validate them).

I liked the many place names rolling past at the beginning but the choice of names and italics made it a bit fantasy-genre for me. Like Doc the 22 really broke it for me and I would prefer it written out in this context.

Thought &#039;a jagged beast of turmoil I have set my heart upon&#039; rang well in the context.

I liked the ending (or absence of one) - climax-less and pointless. Seems to carry the whole feeling of his journey for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like the reflective, contemplative tone of this, and the beautifully restrained balance of the sentences in delineating both the internal and the external landscapes. The absence of context and explanation - I love the memories carved in the stick - really works in capturing a moment and a mood. 

Minor nitpicks: the italicising of placenames is not a standard convention and really jarred for me, as did &quot;22nd&quot; instead of &quot;twenty-second&quot;. I also think the sentence which starts &quot;This odd, dappled forest&quot; is a bit awkward with both a dash and a semicolon, and disrupts the measured beat of the prose. 

Perfect images: &quot;what are heat and haze to me?&quot;, &quot;a jagged beast of turmoil I have set my heart upon&quot;, &quot;who would recognise these memories made real even if carved with perfect grace?&quot; Perfectly balanced sentence: &quot;I notice this: no paths, no creatures, no birds.&quot; Lovely writing.]]></description>
