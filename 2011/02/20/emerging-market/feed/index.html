		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m intrigued by the Manual.  Following the steps of the Manual shouldn&#039;t get you beaten and abandoned in a desert but something similar happened in the past because the Manual suggest how to survive such an event - believe in a new horizon.  But then her/his encounter would be analysed and added to the Manual.  So following the Manual is supposed to have a specific outcome but in case it doesn&#039;t there are various follow up options, that are continuously updated.  Fantastic, they can rely on the Manual to be unreliable but they still follow the Manual and appear to hold it in some sort of reverence.  

I enjoyed the idea of the Manual more than the actual story - oops...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re very good at these tantalising in-the-middle-of-a-story things - I enjoy the way this refuses to commit on whether it&#039;s a futuristic or perfectly mundane salesman whose deal has gone spectacularly sour. I also liked the details of the landscape, the sun/sand etc. If I had any problem with the piece it&#039;s in the ending, which seems a bit abrupt and inconclusive even for this slice-of-longer-narrative thing.]]></description>
