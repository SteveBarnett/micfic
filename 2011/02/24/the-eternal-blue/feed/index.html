		<description><![CDATA[There isn&#039;t really anything to understand.  It&#039;s an experiment, a personal challenge - begin every sentence with T H E  E T E R N A L  B L U E: 

The ever clear blue
Hearts have soared
Endlessly enchanting 

Every day and every
The endless 
Even when down
Round the time
Neverending need 
A time for 
Longing for some

Beyong the waves
Leave the 
Unbelievably
Ever after and .  

Fixed the typos - thanks :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t completely understand this piece. I did get the sense that it was about escape (&quot;Neverending need to be at peace&quot;, &quot;Longing for some restful sleep&quot;) and possibly death (&quot;Ever after and again, eternally sleeping [...]&quot;). I didn&#039;t understand some of the imagery, like &quot;[...]to dream the dreamless dreams.&quot;

&#062; Endlessly enchanting those [...] tall trees.
This sentence read a bit odd to me: I thought that it should be connected to the last sentence by a comma or semi-colon, rather than be on its own.

There were places where I thought more commas would have been good. For example:
&#062; A time for rest so long past[,] together with the aching of the
&#062; broken heart.
and
&#062; [...]the sun is fire[,] the whispers reach those patient ears.

Some typos:
&quot;Neverending&quot; should possibly be &quot;never-ending&quot;.
&quot;Beyong&quot;: beyond
&quot;scourching&quot;: scorching
&quot;Unbelieveably&quot;: unbelievably]]></description>
