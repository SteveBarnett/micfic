		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating how much bleaker the scenario becomes when you rewrite it from the different viewpoint. I preferred the first one, although that&#039;s probably an obvious reason of identification - I find the younger generation here terrifyingly alien, which is clearly the point. It&#039;s also obvious that the final quote means nothing to Zendra - again, this is effective and sad. You seem to have designed this fic to plug straight into all my English teacherness...

I meant to say on the previous version that it might work better to italicise the poetry quotes and leave the lines intact? They run together a bit in this format.]]></description>
