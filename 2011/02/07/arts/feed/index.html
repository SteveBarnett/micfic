		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed this - very evocative of a bored child (actually these are the kind of  thoughts I have when bored so may be it just evokes boredom perfectly)

I like the dark undertones and general sinisterness against the very mundane town life. The simple descriptions of the town and situation work really well for you.

For me the last paragraph is a little obscure and round about - I liked the idea of necromancy being introduced but I thought the vague memory of a vague rumour that he can&#039;t remember was a bit too vague.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the sinister vibes of this one, and the voice of the child is very good - serious consideration of whether the cripple is really a spy or a corpse :) The nice thing is that the childish musings are framed so that by the end the reader is also ready to consider a resurrected corpse... 

I would suggest a &quot;?&quot; after &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;accountants&quot; rather than &quot;accounts&quot;.]]></description>
