		<description><![CDATA[Our Hero owns a cat, Church. The cat has a nasty habit of wondering the neighbourhood and picking up loose odds and ends to present to Our Hero. This habit worsens, until the cat is bringing home money (hoozaah!) and dead body parts (not very much hoozaah!).

		<description><![CDATA[This is great - a slow, measured descent into thriller, and then horror. Told with an interesting voice - from neutral narrator he develops into someone a little more compromised, keeping the gifts as they become more valuable, becoming more and more complicit. Great stuff and a good progression of cat crimes.

A number of smallish niggles:

&quot;it must have weighted as much as him&quot; - should be weighed.

&quot;At least I assumed that’s where it came from; and the neighbours never said anything so it must have been theirs.&quot; - This sentence feels slightly clumsy and unnecessary - story works well without it.

The paragraph about the chicken - I felt a bit of discontinuity there. They hear Church enter with a freshly stolen chicken, but the argument for not returning it is that the housemates had eaten a lot of it. This feels slightly disjointed. Church having chowed it is enough of a reason to not return it; the housemates eating it must have happened after the decision or while they were arguing, or something?

&quot;I suppose we should have told someone; it would have made things easier the next month when Church dragged home a human hand.&quot; This is a great and alarming ending, but something about the writing does not quite work for me. A full stop instead of the semicolon may help. Calling it &quot;the hand&quot; rather than &quot;a hand&quot; may also assist - the definite article is justified as this is definitely THE only human hand they would come across. Possibly &quot;a severed hand&quot; rather than &quot;human hand&quot; may also work - human is implied in hand? 

I loved the half a porn mag paragraph, and rolling in the money with human glee. Worked for me. 

Thanks!]]></description>
