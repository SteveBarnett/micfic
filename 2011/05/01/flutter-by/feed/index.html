		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the idea and the everyday difficulties in trying to express yourself. Loved the butter as yellow stuff while trying to be romantic.

As Parf pointed out a few distracting typo&#039;s but in general I like the smooth transitions between his thought, situation and writing. And the introverted distractions of how the paper looks.

Especially liked these touches:
He smiled to himself at his silliness, returned the page to his desk and began to write
AND
He drew careful lines through the words 

I&#039;m glad the ending was uplifting (as opposed to just focussing on his frustration) and liked the way it directly addressed the basic issues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is sweet - I like it when your characters descend into very Candice-like self examination (reminds me a bit of your spanner story). Words fall apart and nothing makes sense as your characters look a bit to closely.

There are a number of small typos - &quot;though&quot; instead of &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;was fade&quot; rather than &quot;faded&quot; (I think?), had see them on cards - seen, small things but they distract.

The story is about David, who is trying to write love poetry to Sarah but is just too distractedly practical. I like the detour into puppies and examination of butter. Feels very real!

The story changes tone - starting with a very serious thought on fragility of love, moving on to silliness about puppies, then back to very bizarre reflections on veins in butterfly wings, and then on to a very matter-of-fact finish. Some of this works for me, some doesn&#039;t. I am a bit concerned for David and Sarah as the main thought in David&#039;s poetry is that love is fragile and when it disappears, it&#039;s as though it never was - hardly a happy thought!

Thank you, I enjoyed this.]]></description>
