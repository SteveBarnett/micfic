		<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed this - I liked the emotional intensity at the beginning and its slip into fond positive nostalgia by the end. Loved the simple, short (almost terse)  sentences but didn&#039;t understand them as childlike, instead I liked the raw directness they bring to the harsh subject matter. 

I found the switch into direct speech very disturbing, specifically: &#039;They’re not butterflies, she said. They’re moths.&#039; Is this direct speech or indirect in the first sentence and direct in the second? Also this whole dialogue seems a bit pointless.

Final paragraph really works for me and contextualises a very sad little story into a very uplifting moment - I dig!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a beautiful story of a boy who was in an aircraft accident (and probably lost his parents then). He is very injured and needs a lot of therapy. He stays with his aunt somewhere in the countryside, and meets a girl called Anna who becomes his friend. Anna shows him a colony of day-moths and he remembers the feel of the moths on his hands for the rest of his life.

I loved the story but have some nitpicks over the writing. I think Monty has a good point with the changing voice - that may be part of my unease too.

The first paragraph does a sort of unexpected slither from the generic to the specific which jarred me a little. The whole paragraph sketches out a generic &quot;where he&#039;s at&quot; but the last sentence is unexpectedly specific with the sneaking. I would add &quot;one day&quot; to that last sentence, if you see what I mean.

&quot;The intensity of his headaches were frightening&quot; - was frightening?

The paragraph starting with &quot;He never told&quot; is a little disjointed - I&#039;m not sure it adds to the story?

&quot;Some like the day, too!&quot; sounds a bit out of place. Can&#039;t say why.

I love the sentence about ticklish feet. That is exactly what that picture feels like to me! 

thank you, lovely story!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like the feel of this, especially the latter half. The only thing I&#039;d change is that the narration sometimes seems to be in the style of the kid and sometimes the adult, though perhaps that&#039;s deliberate. I just think it might work best if the adult voice comes in only right at the end.

I love the final images of their holding the moths--and it&#039;s a lovely touch that they are day moths, and not butterflies.]]></description>
