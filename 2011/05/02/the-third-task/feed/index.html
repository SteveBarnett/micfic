		<description><![CDATA[Thank you - I definitely aimed for NY, with Audrey Hepburn, Macy&#039;s and tiny creaky lifts to 4th floor apartments.

Your summary is spot on.

I take the nits - the comma can go either way, I think, in this case. I agree &quot;hard&quot; is too colloquial, but &quot;difficult&quot;&#039;s 3 syllables doesn&#039;t flow right. I&#039;ll have a think about it :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!

I&#039;m glad you got the feel of the place - the textures and colours of this strange place. It&#039;s modern myth of some sort - I had something like American Gods in mind, an old power living in the new world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting piece; I enjoyed it. It&#039;s about David, who somehow is accepted into someone&#039;s life to look after their moths. Both David and the moths are in some way mystical, and they teach David various things specific to themselves. The moths are clearly able to speak to him. This is the third of a sequence of tasks which David has to perform for various different people, and it ends when the Moth Lady feels that David is ready to move on to the fourth task. I assume that David is travelling along a mystical path of some kind. 

The setting that sprang to mind was New York City, since I think of Macy&#039;s as a stereotypical NYC chain.

What I enjoyed the most is the slice-of-lifeness of this, where there is no explanation about what is going other than what we can glean from the story. 

Some nits: 

&#062; Audrey Hepburn sort of way.
How is she &quot;sort of&quot; like Audrey Hepburn? I think that the vagueness possibly works here because it comes across as what someone is thinking.

&#062; so far[,] then?
Possibly missing a comma?

&#062; the fourth task is hard.
This is a choice about a character&#039;s voice, but I would have preferred &quot;difficult&quot; over &quot;hard&quot;. In this section our Moth Lady has a bit more of a formal way to her speech (&quot;that will be all&quot;), and &quot;difficult&quot; fits this better (in the sense of how &quot;hard&quot; is being used).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the sense of open mystery and the descriptions of the soft, muted moth world. Love how much is unsaid throughout.

I found this paragraph ,&#039;“David, David. Never tell a lady!...” a little out of place and the sexual connotation odd and disconnected.

For me the montage of moth keeping duties is wonderful especially, &#039;sorted discarded scales by colour and size.&#039; - very fairy tale.

Like how little is shown of our lead character, just a canvas on which to express the story.]]></description>
