		<description><![CDATA[Glad you liked it - I also thought it was cute.
Not sure about the title/slow realisation factor - my original idea was a slow reveal but I thought it was kind of a cheap shot - thus the title, perhaps I should have stuck to xenophobia.

Punctuation - ummm yes - I put comma there too; just not yesterday apparently.

As for urine and moths, I agree it rings wrong - I think its jarring because these moths speak like WASPs and somehow urine is too forthright for them - I should have used some stupid euphemism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a story of two moths, one adventurous and the other quite - conservative? - exploring the idea of sitting on a human. It&#039;s gorgeous and well executed, the tone of voice is perfect for each moth, and the ideas are cute.

The title told me this was going to be moth POV, so if you would prefer this knowledge to seep in slowly you&#039;d have to hide it better. 

You tend not to put a comma before an address in a sentence: I would put comma before each of the &quot;dear&quot;s, as they are inserted in in my view. Same with a comma after &quot;Well&quot;.

I was not sure that moths would mention urine - I don&#039;t know if they do it or if they would call it that. Other than that, the concerns were well expressed. I enjoyed the final description of the hands - a happy ending. 

Thank you!]]></description>
