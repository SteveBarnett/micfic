		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, dude!

&#062; ... retro still comic studio ... movie-style camera directions ...

Yeah, bit of a fliflop mixup. To be honest, the story was a bit rushed, and I think that I didn&#039;t quite end up making a decision either way as to what I should be doing. So you get both - two for the price of one!
Ahem.


&#062; Also found â€˜held up a FLAT handâ€™ odd...

Agreed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great! But agreed on the movie vs. comic book issue. In one of the Sandman novels&#039; intro Gaiman talks about the notes he uses to communicate to the artists, might be interesting to look at that as a reference.

On the whole Mothman thing, this might amuse you:
&quot;Mothman (real name Byron Lewis): A former member of the Minutemen who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness later in life.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[With great power comes the inability to turn from the light.

Really enjoyed the tone and the general 1970-something feel of the pitch/business environment. The short sentences give the impression of nervous excitement which really works for me.

Enjoyed the play around the spider-man ideas, especially the watching the spiders when attacked by the moth.

Think you handled the switch from pitch to sweating men in cheap suits well - had a very real feel to it for me.

I was a little confused by the retro still comic studio at the end in opposition to the movie-style camera directions of the storyline.

Also found &#039;held up a FLAT hand&#039; odd - I think just &#039;held up a hand&#039; would give me the idea .

Dig that the parody obviously holds Spiderman in respect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!

&quot;for school paper&quot; and &quot;down to at&quot; are typos. Will change for printening.

Re movie / comic pitch: um, yeah. I think I was a bit confused myself. Had a couple of ideas and I don&#039;t think I quite split them out properly. Oops!

Re precede / compete / replace: I don&#039;t think it&#039;s clear from the story, so you didn&#039;t miss anything! I had an alternate universe kind of feeling in mind when writing it, but other interpretations are equally valid. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a story about a comic book author pitching an idea to a publisher, Amazing Comics. The idea sounds a lot like the origin myth for Spiderman, except with a moth instead of a spider. He&#039;s nervous, but they like the pitch and hire him.

This is brilliant and well conceived. The language, movie type pitch, works really well, and succeeds at putting a lot of story into a small space. The pitch is perfect, and describing the camera movements really makes this into a movie in your head.

There are a couple of small niggles: 
He works _for_ the school paper, not _on_? 
Divebombs - I would prefer dives.
&quot;down to at hero&quot; sounds awkward - down to hero?

I also was not sure if his whole hand glowed red at the end.

My big questions are:
Throughout, I thought this was a movie pitch, not a comic book pitch. The descriptions of camera angles and particularly of camera movements made me think this - there was a lot of motion which would not come across in comic panels?

And, 
I&#039;m not sure if &quot;Mothman&quot; is going to precede Spiderman, compete with him, replace him? What is the significance of the title? I suspect I missed a crucial something!

I liked the story very much. Thank you!]]></description>
