		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the triple ambiguity - moths and light, men and woman, victims and witch. Think the idea worked really well and especially the brotherhood of the victims sat very well with me.

Love your descriptions of the fantasy goals and quests - you have a great touch with these things, interesting readable text but still giving the impression the specific quests are arbitrary.

I might have liked to some personality in the woman - really she is simply a cold manipulative bitch - she doesn&#039;t even seem pleased by their submission - but I suppose she is like a flame - a force of nature.

Interesting - your most negative portrayal of both genders yet I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a hypnotic fairytale, shimmering through different realities - are they moths or men? Is she flame or witch?

Ok, (I think) this is a story about two suitors fascinated by the same woman. I think the suitors are men, or moth men, but it&#039;s possible that they are moths. In fact, it occurs to me that you would like us to read it both ways - a shimmering of realities like seeing through different layers of illusions. They both are obsessed with the same creature - woman, witch, or flame - who openly toys with them and uses them to fetch unlikely quest objects, which she uses for strange magic. When they are worn out by the constant quests, she looks for new suitors, while the old ones are discarded. They don&#039;t seem to mind.

I love the way that the love and friendship actually grows between the rivals, as the woman becomes a distant plot device, an untouchable reward, while they become real to one another. The graceful resignation they both have for their lives works well - they know the rewards are small and are satisfied with the little they get.

I loved the magical quests - all lovely and whimsical, very much down my alley.

I was initially a little jarred by the voice - I think it&#039;s a little self-conscious about trying to be a male character&#039;s POV. I think the use of the word &quot;manly&quot; as self description is the crux of the problem. This is only an initial impression and fades as the story takes its course.

Lovely! As a matter of interest, which 75 words were the initial story?]]></description>
