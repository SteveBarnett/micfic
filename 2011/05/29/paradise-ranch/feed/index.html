		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment! I&#039;m glad you liked this. I&#039;m oddly happy with it myself, and I think it worked out much how I wanted. You&#039;re right about the &quot;locked box&quot; bit. If I was editing this again, I might leave that sentence out and do some minor rewording around it. 

Am feeling guilty about the general lack of commenting that&#039;s happened for the last two micfics. I&#039;m glad that we&#039;ve gone through to the end of the volume, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, my. I loved this - delicate, subtle, evocative, poignant. Rather characteristic, in fact :&#062;. Alien conspiracy as metaphor works &lt;i&gt;beautifully&lt;/i&gt;, and the tone - gentle, considered, matter-of-fact - is extremely effective. Thank you, very happy reading experience.

If I&#039;m going to nit-pick, the box &quot;locked with your mind and with your emotions&quot; is perhaps a little obvious and flatly stated, in contrast to the nuance of the rest of it. But it&#039;s an extremely minor niggle.]]></description>
