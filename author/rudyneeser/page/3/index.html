		<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->The guards let only one of them down the passage to Socrates’ room; it had been promptly decided that the merchant Crito would be that one. A stern warder left him outside the barred door of the sceptic’s cell.</p>
<p>Socrates sat huddled in the corner of the candle-lit room, but the old man jumped up when the door opened. “Crito!” he said. “I’m so glad to see you. But what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Crito closed the door behind himself. “Hush,” he told his friend. “Gather your things, we need to go.”</p>
<p>“Go? I don’t understand —”</p>
<p>“I’m here — and Simmias and Cebes too — to buy your freedom. Come, the guards will let us pass if we go quickly.”</p>
<p>“No Crito, I’m not going. Not like this.”</p>
<p>“Come now, Socrates. We can’t let it be said that Crito was too cheap to buy his friend’s escape! We must hurry.” Crito reached to take Socrates by his tunic’s sleeve, but the sceptic pulled away from him.</p>
<p>“I can’t, Crito. I can’t.”</p>
<p>And so Crito went alone to the exit of that place; and he faced Simmias and Cebes and told them, “Socrates is too stubborn for his own good.”</p>
<p>“What did he say?” Cebes asked.</p>
<p>“That when he came to this City he agreed to abide by its rules, even benefited from them. Leaving now, he thinks he’ll damage the state and society. Injustice cannot be answered with injustice.”</p>
<p>Simmias sighed and shrugged and said, “His always been wiser and stupider than everyone else.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” said Crito. “I need to rest, then. I want to be with him at his execution.”</p>

		<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; }a:link {  } -->First the alarm rings in its noisy and ephemeral way. Then there’s relaxing in a bed still warm from the night’s sleep, and also stretching. Stretching is good. Outside the morning birds are a wild orchestra, singing from the trees and bushes and telephone poles.</p>
<p>The coffee smells strong and pungent and the cup is gently warm. Breakfast is oats, boiled with raisins and cinnamon. The raisins swell; they’re a juicy, sweet contrast to the oats’s bland stolidness.</p>
<p>The morning jog is quick because work is calling. The air is fresh and the park empty — why do runners not seem to enjoy the morning flowers and the smell of dew on the grass? The jog is invigorating, and the hot shower that follows more refreshing than the coffee was.</p>
<p>But that isn’t how things are. The alarm rings and you — through force of will — climb out of bed (where the warmth no longer holds any attraction). The coffee is just coffee. It tastes bitter but you drink it because it’s familiar and habitual. You have no energy to exercise, and truly you never had the time. What’d you been thinking: it makes the morning a mad rush to eat and wash and dress. Enough with it. But it’s already been a few days since you’ve stopped exercising and it’s not something you think about any more. Now the only thing left is to wonder if she’s woken up yet. If she misses you. And you know this:</p>
<p>She is waking, and she might be thinking of you, but she doesn’t miss you.</p>

		<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->He loves me. I know he does. I have seen the signs.</p>
<p>When I first saw him he was toying with his tie. Loosening it, tugging it, worrying it. The cop he played was in Miami and it was supposed to be hot and humid and sticky. But he was all style and class: that tie would never come off.</p>
<p>I knew what he meant by playing with it. I knew what he was telling me.</p>
<p>Last night when he put his fingers to his lips (contemplatively, gently) he was telling her that he no longer loved her. He didn&#8217;t want to be having coffee with her, didn&#8217;t want to be in the restaurant with her. But he&#8217;s too polite — he couldn&#8217;t just come out and say it. Still, she didn&#8217;t get the message. She should have. She should have seen the signs, read the signals. He&#8217;s not meant for her.</p>
<p>All evening he kept glancing over at me.</p>
<p>He knew I was there. We were in the same room and I couldn’t take my eyes off of him; his presence was overpowering. When he looked at me it was electric. When he walked up to me and shouted, I felt angry — but it was something he had to do, to keep up his heterosexual façade for her. The feeling of his clenched, taut fists hitting me — God. Oh God.</p>
<p>The waiter didn’t understand and threw me out. But the world can&#8217;t keep us apart.</p>
<p>Tonight I&#8217;m going to his house. His wife needs to be told. She needs to know. She can&#8217;t come between us forever.</p>

		<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } --> <!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->Scheherazade had always loved stories. Telling them to her husband Shahryar had at first been exhilarating — now the tedium of it, the stress of it, had grown tiring. So many other women were dead because they had failed to convince Shahryar that they should live — would tonight, she wondered, be her turn?</p>
<p>Could she begin another story after this, one to leave incomplete  at the night’s end and so ensure her life for another day? She looked into Shahryar’s eyes, and said:</p>
<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } --></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“River had to write a story. He worked nights on it because he spent half of each day studying, half making money. Bills, River knew, didn’t pay themselves. He was divided: not two-ways, but three. He wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">“Troy Packham sits in his parents’ cold, porcelain bathtub. If you listen you can hear him crying — harsh, uneven, staccato. In his right hand he clasps his father’s straight razor, but he can’t bring himself to cut.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">“When he finally quietens, Troy climbs out of the tub and says into the mirror, ‘Fuck this shit.’ He walks out of the bathroom. Out of the house. Away from the city.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“River thought that his story needed more work. A better ending, perhaps. But then so did his studies, so did his contract work. This all had to stop, he decided. He went to kitchen to think over a cup of tea.”</p>
<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->Scheherazade finished her story. The roosters were crowing and the sky brightening. She began no other tale.</p>
<p>“What does it mean?” Shahryar asked.</p>
<p>His wife shrugged, then said, “Love, let me sleep a bit. We can talk later.”</p>

The cords that had tied her hands dropped to the ground. Her wrists were raw and a finger maybe broken, but she was nearly free! Untying the knots that secured her feet to the chair was almost easy, only her feet distracted her. They showed her what he had already done: he’d taken his tools to her while she’d been secured with knot and rope. His spanners had grasped at toes — twisting, snapping. The pliers — pointed and vicious and unforgiving — had ripped at nails.</p>
<p>Walking was difficult — pain lanced through each foot and into her calves. Her toes could take no weight. She limped, flat-footed, towards the window, only to find it closed and barred. “Of course!” she wanted to cry — but she kept her anguish silent. Noise would only return his attention to the room.</p>
<p>If the window was no escape, there was still the door. She began moving towards it.</p>
<p>Her slow, careful steps were because of her pain; but they also meant silence, meant little creaking of the floorboards. Meant a greater chance of going unnoticed.</p>
<p>Only this is when she fell.</p>
<p>The pain in her feet was greater than her need to support her weight; they betrayed her. She collapsed to the ground, shocked by the impact, by her hands hitting the floor, by trying to support her weight on them and failing to do so. The sound of her collapse was a limp, hollow, thud. She wanted to scream.</p>
<p>And then the door opened.</p>

		<p><!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->Vicky thought about shopping the whole day at work. It was candles and feathers that she wanted — fat candles, thin candles, enough to fill a whole room. Concentrating on spreadsheets and costings was difficult, the data entry tedious and unexciting; Vicky’s mind kept slipping from the precision, emptiness and drudgery of numbers to the excitement of candles and flame, the firm suppleness of feathers.</p>
<p>Anticipation wasn’t Vicky’s alone. Each of the drudge-workers kept track of the time, could feel the day’s end approaching. Work slowed down, spreadsheets filled with increasing sluggishness; at five o’clock a ripple flowed through the workers — then they stood up from their cubicles, one after the other, in a muted, tired, mistimed wave; put on their coats, took up their bags, departed.</p>
<p>Vicky held her own bag and coat tight against the chill.</p>
<p>Candles were easy to find, being everywhere, in each shop. The feathers were the problem. At this last minute she only managed to find a feather duster which, she was assured, was made of genuine ostrich feathers. She ripped out a single feather and threw the rest into her bedroom cupboard.</p>
<p>The candles she arrayed around her bedroom, beacons of flame resting on the bookshelves and dresser. A short, fat, unlit candle remained on the nightstand. Beside it, the feather. But alone the feather seemed bland, a forgotten frippery. Vicky arranged the feather over her handcuffs, mixing dull colours and hard steel.</p>
<p>Vicky waited for the doorbell in her kitchen with a glass of merlot in hand.</p>

		<p><!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->The forest trees hid the sunlight, their bowers heavy with dark green leaves, trunks carpeted in thickened moss. They silenced the forest sounds — there was no bird song, no insect call. No footfalls. A wolf stalked James through the forest and he couldn’t hear it. Only it wasn’t a wolf but a gnarled-toothed werewolf, sharp toothed and vicious.</p>
<p>But that was a bedtime story; James was safe at home, tucked tight under his blankets, warm up to his shoulders, secure in bedtime comfort. After his mother finished the story she kissed his cheek and tussled his hair, turned off the bedside lamp and closed the door behind her. Left in darkness James felt no fear. He enjoyed horror stories, and the best was yet to come.</p>
<p>The small ones came out first, all beard and mouth and teeth; bouncing from under the bed they jumped up to his feet and waited. The Cupboard Monster was the show-master, the speaker. It was calmness and stateliness. It’s fur luminesced and its voice was sliding gravel.</p>
<p>It said, “And now we begin.” The story was about the boy Abel; he and his family were chased from their home and hunted — not by werewolves, but by other men. They killed Abel’s mother in front of him. There was guns and violence, anger and hatred. His father stowed him away on a boat. Abel never saw his homeland or his father again. There was bravery, love and loss.</p>
<p>This story wasn’t as good as the previous night’s, where 800 000 people had been slaughtered in only 100 days. But it had been entertaining and thrilling, and that was all James asked for in his bedtime tales.</p>

		<p><!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->From the street the Jenkins estate seems as quiet as usual. A uniformed groundsman, clippers in hand, tends to the hedges. The quietness is interrupted only by the snapping of his clippers and the soft song of birds in the trees. It is difficult to say what the groundsman is thinking of — perhaps of rich people and the seclusion they make for themselves.</p>
<p>Inside, along the wainscotted passages, a brief peal of laughter rings out, and, as sudden and brief as a flight of birds, the clinking of champagne flutes. This comes from the Main Dining Room, where most of the household stands around the old oak table, toasting life, the family’s thoroughbred, and Craig, their jockey. Craig leans over to Mary Jenkins and whispers something in her ear; she touches his arm and laughs again. In two months they will marry, with smiles just as large and white as now. In three years they will have divorced, but they’ll still dream of this day from time to time.</p>
<p>Across the estate’s paddock, beneath a looming acacia, are the stables. Sure Thing rests in her stall, but isn’t offered any celebration for her win. She chews from a bag of oats, mostly ignoring the boy Timmy Lagrange who shines her bay coat with a body brush. Timmy also doesn’t celebrate; I like to think that he’s imagining being old enough to race, perhaps on a horse as fine as Sure Thing. But maybe he’s only thinking of home, warm food, and a bed to rest in.</p>
