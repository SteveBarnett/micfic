				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fellow MicFictioneers,</p>
<p>I have been busy laying out <em>MicFic: The Bookering</em>, and have a question. At the moment I&#8217;m laying out themes as a double page spread. I&#8217;ve hacked together a PNG of what that looks like, but you should have a look at <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/example.pdf">the example file</a>. The left page is currently blank for the image, while the right page gives the theme title and a little quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/spread.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885" style="border:1px solid black;" title="spread" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/spread.png" alt="" width="497" height="352" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken the quotes from one of the micfic entries for that theme (the one above is, conveniently, from my entry for <em>Ghost</em>). I&#8217;ve also made sure that each person has a quote, but this does pose a question: what quotes do you micfictioneers feel are your best?</p>
<p>If you want to let me know, reply with a list of your own favourite quotes (that means quotes from your own stories, not someone elses!), one from each piece, like so:</p>
<p>Stop: &#8220;It was a dark and stormy night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gone: &#8220;Then he turned to me and said, &#8216;Poof! Gone!'&#8221;</p>
<p>Ghost: &#8220;Oh. My. God.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so on! I will then choose between the quotes, and try to get your most preferred quote into the Bookering.</p>
<p>Also, if you disapprove of quotes, now is the time to raise your voice in protest!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
