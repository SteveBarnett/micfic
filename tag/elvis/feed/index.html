				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I just&#8230; I just don&#8217;t see how this is helping,&#8221; he said, head bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to see. You don&#8217;t need to understand, Elvis. You just need to follow orders.&#8221; The Colonel stood up, making motions to leave. He felt a pang of pity for the soldier, remembered when he was in a similar situation many moons ago. A few less sequins, though. A lot less junk food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel,&#8221; he said, edging closer, &#8220;it&#8217;s not me.&#8221; He glanced around, afraid that someone was watching, listening. &#8220;I can&#8217;t pretend to be this person anymore. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m fooling anyone. And this.&#8221; He brushed a burger aside and picked up a sheet of music from his make-up table. &#8220;Blue Suede Shoes. Carl did this, a few months ago. An extra body was shipped in for him, he burnt through the first one so fast. Why do I have to do the same song again?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel sighed, ran his paw through his slick-backed tentacles. He brushed some glitter from his insignia.Â &#8220;Listen to me, son,&#8221; he said, placing his hand gently on Elvis&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;This planet is important to us. Not just you and I, not just the military, but our people. Our race. This Thread is important to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elvis looked at his mentor and tears welled up in his eyes behind his sunglasses. He longed to be free of this body, of this place with its heavy gravity. He turned to his mirror and wiped his eyes. He stood up and shook his hips at his reflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s one for the money&#8230;&#8221;</p>
