				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->The scent of it is such a rare thing in this struggling, forsaken neighbourhood. “But of course it  smells delectable,” I tell those who ask. “That’s real meat.” It not only smells good, it tastes good too. Tomato soup with roast red peppers and meatballs. Beef and vegetable soup: fresh carrots, fried potatoes, leeks, cauliflower, and — of course — beef-on-the-bone. Beautiful.</p>
<p>But, even though I sell meals full of the goodness of fresh meat, they always complain. “It’s a bit gamy,” they say.</p>
<p>I say, “That’s only extra flavour. And the toughness cooks out.” They never notice the toughness; don’t know why I bring it up.</p>
<p>“Stop complaining,” I tell them. “If you don’t like it, get it somewhere else.” And there’s a joke in that: I’m the only game in town for those who don’t want their meat from a can.</p>
<p>My neighbours blame the missing animals on me. “Where the hell’s your beef from?” they shout.</p>
<p>“Are you dim enough you can’t tell the difference between <em>cat </em>and <em>beef</em>?” I yell back. Still, I sell them soup at a discount, to appease them. Apparently it’s good soup, whether Fluffy’s the secret ingredient or not.</p>
<p>Ah, meat. They’ll do anything for it. And I’m glad of that. I’m an old lady now and there’s no one to look after me but me myself. And the bit of cash a good bowl of soup brings in does me good.</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
